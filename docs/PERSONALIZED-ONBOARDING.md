## Advanced Build Mechanics

### **Character Resonance System**

#### **Resonance Unlock Requirements**
- **3 Stars**: First resonance unlocks
- **6 Stars**: Second resonance unlocks
- **Higher character levels = stronger resonance effects**

#### **Recommended Resonance Characters**

**3-Star Resonance (First Slot):**
- **Rolla** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê - **BEST CHOICE**
  - Freeze attacks provide vital crowd control
  - Any stop in opponent attacks = major advantage
  - Critical damage boost
- **Helix** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê - Strong alternative
  - Damage scaling abilities
  - Good for DPS builds
- **Thor** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê - Legendary option
  - Lightning abilities
  - Move while firing + weapon detach

**6-Star Resonance (Second Slot):**
- **Loki** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê - **TOP CHOICE**
  - PvP specific character
  - Attack speed boost when moving
  - Acquired from PvP rewards
- **Demon King** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê - Shield specialist
  - Powerful shield abilities
  - Skins enhance shield capabilities
- **Otta** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê - High-level option
  - Strong at higher levels
  - Good for advanced builds

**Alternative 3-Star Options:**
- **Nyanja** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê - Speed specialist
  - Faster movement = harder to hit
  - Good for Griffin builds
  - Cloudfooted ability (damage + push)

### **Character Selection Strategy**

#### **Primary Character Selection**
1. **Use highest star character** (3+ stars for resonance)
2. **If you have a Legendary**: Usually best unless highest star is 3+
3. **Resonance unlocks at 3 stars** - this is the key threshold

#### **Resonance Power Scaling**
- **Level 7 Rolla** >> **3-star Rolla** for resonance
- Character level directly affects resonance strength
- Higher level = more powerful resonance effects

### **Build Type Recommendations**

#### **Dragon Builds**
- **Focus**: High damage, tanky gameplay
- **Best Characters**: Thor, Demon King
- **Resonance**: Rolla (freeze) + Loki (speed)
- **Items**: Dragon Knight set, high HP items

#### **Oracle Builds** 
- **Focus**: Balanced, versatile gameplay
- **Best Characters**: Helix, Alex
- **Resonance**: Rolla (freeze) + Demon King (shield)
- **Items**: Oracle set, balanced stats

#### **Griffin Builds**
- **Focus**: Speed, mobility gameplay
- **Best Characters**: Nyanja, Griffin
- **Resonance**: Nyanja (speed) + Loki (attack speed)
- **Items**: Griffin set, speed bonuses

## AI Questions Channel Integration
