# Discord Bot Project - AI Assistant Rules

## üìä DATA STRUCTURE - CRITICAL

### Single Source of Truth
**ONLY use: `xyian-bot-project/data/real-structured-data/unified_game_data.json`**

This is the ONLY active data file. All other data sources have been archived to `data/outdated-data/` and must NOT be used.

### Data Quality Standards

**GOOD DATA** ‚úÖ:
- Clean, complete game facts
- Specific weapon names (Griffin Claws, Dragoon Crossbow, Dragoon Bow)
- Character builds with details
- Gear set bonuses and use cases
- Rune effects and combinations
- Game mode strategies
- NO usernames, NO timestamps, NO chat fragments

**BAD DATA** ‚ùå:
- Discord usernames (e.g., "Awesomethanu Senior Archer")
- Timestamps (e.g., "827 AM", "10:25 PM")
- Incomplete sentences or fragments
- Chat noise like "(edited)", "1", emojis without context
- References to users asking questions
- Off-topic discussions

### Data Sources (Current Status)

**ACTIVE**:
- `xyian-bot-project/data/real-structured-data/unified_game_data.json` ‚úÖ ONLY USE THIS

**ARCHIVED** (reference only, DO NOT USE):
- `data/outdated-data/comprehensive-knowledge-base/` ‚ùå Discord chatter noise
- `data/outdated-data/cleaned-database/` ‚ùå Still too noisy
- `data/outdated-data/structured-tables/` ‚ùå Superseded by unified data

## ü§ñ BOT ARCHITECTURE

### Data Loading
- Bot uses `working-rag-system.js` which loads `unified_game_data.json`
- NO direct loading of comprehensive-knowledge-base
- NO fallback to noisy data sources

### Response Generation
- RAG system searches unified_game_data.json
- Returns structured, clean responses
- Includes PVP ratings, gear set info, combinations

### Key Example: PVP Weapons
When asked "what's the best PVP weapon?", bot MUST mention:
1. **Griffin Claws** - S-tier with Griffin set (broken OP at chaotic tier)
2. **Dragoon Crossbow** - S-tier best overall for mixed sets
3. **Dragoon Bow** - A-tier for Dragoon builds

## üìù UPDATING DATA

### How to Add New Information
1. Edit `xyian-bot-project/data/real-structured-data/unified_game_data.json`
2. Follow existing structure for each category
3. Include all relevant fields (pvp_rating, best_for, combinations, etc.)
4. Run validation: `node xyian-bot-project/validate-data-quality.js`
5. Test bot responses before committing

### Data Format Rules
```json
{
  "weapons": {
    "weapon_name": {
      "aka": "alternative name",
      "type": "ranged/melee/magic",
      "pvp_rating": "S-tier / A-tier description",
      "gear_set": "which gear set it pairs with",
      "best_for": ["use case 1", "use case 2"],
      "combinations": ["combo 1", "combo 2"],
      "note": "Pro tip or important detail"
    }
  }
}
```

### Validation Checklist
Before adding data, ensure:
- [ ] No usernames or Discord handles
- [ ] No timestamps
- [ ] Complete sentences
- [ ] Specific game facts
- [ ] Proper JSON syntax
- [ ] All relevant fields included

## üöÄ RAILWAY DEPLOYMENT

### Environment Variables Required
- `DISCORD_TOKEN` - Bot token
- `OWNER_ID` - Your Discord user ID (for training commands)
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` - Optional, for AI features

### Persistent Data
- `/data` volume mounted for persistence
- `unified_game_data.json` persists across deployments
- Training data stored in `data/user-training/`

### Deployment Command
```bash
cd xyian-bot-project
npm install
node ultimate-xyian-bot.js
```

## üéì TRAINING SYSTEM

### Discord Commands (Owner Only)
- `/train <topic> <correct_info>` - Add/update game information
- `/feedback thumbs_up/thumbs_down` - Rate bot responses
- `/correct <correction>` - Fix incorrect answers

### Local Training
```bash
node xyian-bot-project/train-bot.js
```

### Training Data Flow
1. Training input collected via Discord or CLI
2. Validated for quality (no Discord chatter)
3. Stored in `data/user-training/training-log.json`
4. Reviewed and merged into `unified_game_data.json`

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL REMINDERS

### What NOT to Do
1. ‚ùå DO NOT load data from comprehensive-knowledge-base
2. ‚ùå DO NOT load data from cleaned-database
3. ‚ùå DO NOT add Discord usernames to unified_game_data.json
4. ‚ùå DO NOT add timestamps to unified_game_data.json
5. ‚ùå DO NOT create alternative data files - use unified_game_data.json

### What TO Do
1. ‚úÖ ONLY use unified_game_data.json
2. ‚úÖ Validate data quality before adding
3. ‚úÖ Include specific weapon/character/rune names
4. ‚úÖ Add PVP ratings and gear set info
5. ‚úÖ Keep data clean and structured

## üìö Documentation

### Key Files to Read First
1. `xyian-bot-project/DATA-STRUCTURE.md` - Data organization
2. `xyian-bot-project/PROJECT-STATUS.md` - Current state
3. `xyian-bot-project/CHANGELOG.md` - Version history
4. `xyian-bot-project/README.md` - Setup and usage

### Getting Started
```bash
# Read the data structure
cat xyian-bot-project/data/real-structured-data/unified_game_data.json

# Test bot responses
node xyian-bot-project/working-rag-system.js

# Validate data quality
node xyian-bot-project/validate-data-quality.js
```

## üéØ QUALITY GOALS

### Success Criteria
- Bot mentions Griffin Claws AND Dragoon Bow for PVP weapon questions
- No Discord chatter in responses
- All responses use clean, structured data
- Daily tips use real game facts (no usernames/timestamps)
- Training system allows easy updates without losing quality

### Testing
Always test these queries after changes:
1. "what's the best PVP weapon?"
   - Must mention: Griffin Claws, Dragoon Crossbow, Dragoon Bow
2. "best PVP build?"
   - Must include gear + characters + runes
3. "tell me about Griffin set"
   - Must mention it's broken OP at chaotic tier with claws

**Remember**: This project has been cleaned up from 1,367 noisy Discord messages to ~40 high-quality structured entries. Keep it that way!
