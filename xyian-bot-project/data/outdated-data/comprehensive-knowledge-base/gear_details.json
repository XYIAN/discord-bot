Happy to help the community. I only really have trouble with the spinning flowers. Not sure how to fully 'dodge' them at a lower level. The higher power (quicker you kill them) it's not a big deal because you kill them fast enough. And also the Scythe Mages... Stay away from the walls really and dodge the bounces. Princess Nyxx 6/5/25, 8:48 AM I always move counter clockwise on the spinning flowers. So if it's at 12oclock, I position at 9 and move to 6. It will then move to 6 o'clock and I move to 3.

This will also keep him in close if you are using circle attack/runes. After movement, shoot shoot move. • Second attack is typically jump attack then immediate meteors. If you can get one shot off in between these attacks go for it, but not at the cost of eating a meteor. After the meteors fall, shoot shoot move. • Lastly, you have the flame shot that splits into 6. The triangle method is perfect to avoid this because it may be a charge. Avoid the flame, possibly shoot, move to avoid the flame spread, shoot again.

A rolling bowling boulder attack that eventually splits into 6. The big boulder will also track/follow. , (If this big boulder hits a wall, it will not split and will disappear) A triple rock split. , (Edit) Lastly, he also shoots 5 fast boulders at that are mostly guaranteed hits if you are close to him. , (If you freeze or paralyze him, he will never throw these) • This boss will always throw with his right arm. • My trick is to stand mostly in between him in the center and the wall. This is in the hopes when he tosses the boulder, it will cancel. If it’s the triple rock split you’re still good to go. , • The biggest point is to always rotate to dodge in a counterclockwise direction. This is to have to better chance of dodging the tosses. If you dodge clockwise, you run a much bigger risk of taking a bolder or rock throw. , (edited) 1 1 September 30, 2025 My pve set is xbow, oracle amulet, griffin ring, oracle chest, dragoon helm, oracle boots (all M0-M2) frog Senior Archer 9/30/25, 5:21 PM What a My pve set is xbow, oracle amulet, griffin ring, oracle chest, dragoon helm, oracle boots (all M0-M2) MX4 Novice Explorer 9/30/25, 6:20 PM Can I ask why griffin ring with xbow?

If you have otta's nian skin at 4 or 5 stars and otta at 2 then the potion spring will proc in the majority of battles. If it happens to proc on invincible pot you can beat people with much higher power. Sprites awe is the more consistent option but potion spring has a significantly higher ceiling For full oracle users swords plus potion spring seems to be working better than double sprite etched in arena as far as I can tell. I'm a mixed set user so I haven't tested it personally but that's what it looks like to me from a distance pimpanzee Junior Archer 9/29/25, 3:42 PM Is it 25% chance to spawn every time I grab a pot!? Why is it great for nian otta? AFAICT, potions do not trigger anything besides their effects and it seems to not trigger very often Exodus the Coach | P90015619 Elite Archer 9/29/25, 3:45 PM Even with what shadow inputed if you're running pots springs on oracle for example nian otta pot triggers every 2 sec lvl it up increases the odds to pots every sec and potion magnet mythic increased you're likely hood for pots springs trigger. Its 1/4 but your chances increased with otta and enchant plus the pots skill if you grab it in arena either way you're still having more value even if it doesn't pop (edited) If does pop you're pretty much winning the round For meteor and strikes builds its pretty much standard (edited) Is it 25% chance to spawn every time I grab a pot!? Shadowfax88 Legendary Archer 9/29/25, 4:01 PM Yes, it does. Like exodus said, it shows up in many pvp/gvg builds. Where it doesn't work well is if you use Thor as a resonance because he moves too much and just runs out of the potion spring range too often pimpanzee Junior Archer 9/29/25, 4:08 PM Well that makes much more sense! The description could be clearer. I thought just 25% of matches it would trigger Thanks the Coach | P90015619 October 1, 2025 Fenrirus Novice Explorer 10/1/25, 8:35 AM Oracle user + Thor + otta costume in gvg i should use aoe and which one etched rune(potion, old sword or maybe new sword)? which one push to legendary first.

Exodus the Coach | P90015619 Elite Archer 10/1/25, 10:26 AM Running strikes on thor is trash because the strikes won't shoot out unless you're facing them which pretty much thor doesn't do often . If you're going strikes thor is useless Aerie ledgendary then pots spring leg. Pots spring leg just gives more potions when it procs.... but i think Aerie first will net you better results in arena Splits is easier to get ledgendary because you have access to it in guildshop but aerie is still better Guild expo Fenrirus Novice Explorer 10/1/25, 10:54 AM Thanks i have frost shock rune with sword enchant and i saw sword dmg in arena. Never thinked about swords doesnt proc with Thor. I know swords hit only enemy on front of hero Leg aerie better than split ? Split generate 5 swords.

Shadowfax88 Legendary Archer 9/26/25, 12:14 PM I'm not positive on this but I'm pretty sure crit damage calculation works like this. All sources of damage that are able to crit have a base crit damage of +50% and additional crit damage is additive to that. Global crit damage works the same way as global crit rate (it only effects main weapon, swords and non explosive meteors). At least this is my understanding but I'm not positive.

September 26, 2025 meteor is also impact by elemental dmg right? as it has different elements too Shadowfax88 Legendary Archer 9/26/25, 10:34 AM Yes, meteors cause supplemental elemental damage. The elemental damage aspect can crit if you have lucky shadow. The explosive meteor damage itself only crits if you have the meteor crit rate enchantment The base 5% crit rate is considered global crit rate. This impacts main weapon, sword strikes and non-explosive meteors. Elemental base crit rate is determined by luck. If you run lucky shadow, I believe the base rate is 10%. This can be increased by elemental crit rate +% enchants on runes and the elemental crit etched. All other (circles, sprites and explosive meteors) have a base crit of 0%. These can only be increased by their specific crit rate +% enchants (except for circles if you have mythic sawblade where circles inherit main weapon crit) Explosions never crit (for example... xbow explosion on hit and other dragoon gear) Awesomethanu Senior Archer 9/26/25, 12:00 PM back to this, it is the same for crit dmg right? if i use xbow with meteor and i have meteor crit rate enchant but dont have meteor crit dmg, does the normal crit dmg applies? or same as crit rate, normal crit dmg works on MW, SWORD STRIKES AND NON EXPLOSIVE METOERS? back to this, it is the same for crit dmg right? if i use xbow with meteor and i have meteor crit rate enchant but dont have meteor crit dmg, does the normal crit dmg applies? Shadowfax88 Legendary Archer 9/26/25, 12:14 PM I'm not positive on this but I'm pretty sure crit damage calculation works like this. All sources of damage that are able to crit have a base crit damage of +50% and additional crit damage is additive to that. Global crit damage works the same way as global crit rate (it only effects main weapon, swords and non explosive meteors). At least this is my understanding but I'm not positive. If you have an enchant for meteor crit damage +30% and that meteor crits it will end up doing 180% damage. I believe the calculation is for explosive meteors is this. Explosive meteor damage (1.25x atk) (explosion multiplier (=3 from xbow) + crit damage multiplier) meteor multiplier (from left side meteor runes) dragoon helm multiplier (=2 if helm is chaotic) (edited) Shadowfax88 Legendary Archer 9/26/25, 12:31 PM I'm pretty sure that formula is accurate. The only thing I'm not certain on is if the global crit damage is also applied to it. I'll see if I can find out (edited) Shadowfax88 Legendary Archer 9/26/25, 12:47 PM I can confirm that elements that crit only use the elemental crit damage multiplier (unless you have the elemental crit etched that allows them to inherit % of character crit). I haven't been able to test meteors because I don't have meteor crit rate enchants Awesomethanu Senior Archer 9/26/25, 12:47 PM how do u do the test i have meteor crit rate but low rate Shadowfax88 Legendary Archer 9/26/25, 12:50 PM By unequiping everything except for runes/gear that have the variables you are testing for and then doing practice runs in seal or invasion. Turn on damage numbers. Meteors are a little harder to test because they also apply elemental damage so the screen gets a little more clogged but is possible Awesomethanu Senior Archer 9/26/25, 1:04 PM It seems like it does. Trying to send you the video Not sure if I done it correctly though File is too big to send Is this crit? Shadowfax88 Legendary Archer 9/26/25, 1:10 PM Yes, that is a crit. But I just got confirmation that explosive meteors that crit just use meteor crit damage multiplier from enchants and not global crit rate Are you sure there were no other variables in your test that may have impacted overall damage numbers? Awesomethanu Senior Archer 9/26/25, 1:17 PM I don’t have any meteor crit dmg enchantments Shadowfax88 Legendary Archer 9/26/25, 1:19 PM That crit damage could be coming from another source then. Such as the xbow attack Plus the base crit damage for explosive meteors is +50% even if you don't have any other ones. The meteor crit damage enchants are additive to that Awesomethanu Senior Archer 9/26/25, 1:21 PM I’m moving towards wall to refrain myself from attacking all the time. Not sure if I slipped my fingers or not but I think most of the time I didn’t. Who are you getting the information from ? Shadowfax88 Legendary Archer 9/26/25, 1:22 PM People in the vip chat who have both tested and asked devs Awesomethanu Senior Archer 9/26/25, 1:22 PM Ok cool Since more like it then So In short if u only had meteor crit rate it is pointless to use it without meteor crit dmg. For those with explosion dmg Shadowfax88 Legendary Archer 9/26/25, 1:42 PM You can still use meteor crit rate because of the base crit damage multiplier Yes, that is a crit. But I just got confirmation that explosive meteors that crit just use meteor crit damage multiplier from enchants and not global crit rate TodoNuDeMeias Senior Archer 9/26/25, 2:29 PM So in this case meteors would do 130% if we had a crit enchant of +30%?

I would think no because sprites inherit owner's crit rate I think would refer to global crit rate extremelyaverage Senior Archer 10/3/25, 12:24 PM yeah assist 2.

So global crit would be your base+ artifacts and does not include weapon crit or characters? And I get that we wont know until someone physically tries it Shadowfax88 Legendary Archer 10/3/25, 12:37 PM It's confusing because some things in the game are not worded properly. Anything that says crit +% with no specific damage type modifiers in front of it are typically considered to be global crit and anything that says \"inherit character/owner crit\" would use this number. The exceptions to this are oracle boots, spear, griffin helm and otta 2 which are all worded in a way that would imply global crit but what they really mean are main weapon crit (edited) Rolla's passive, on the other hand, is a global crit multiplier extremelyaverage Senior Archer 10/3/25, 12:38 PM as is otta's passive?

Explosive meteor damage (1.25x atk) (explosion multiplier (=3 from xbow) + crit damage multiplier) meteor multiplier (from left side meteor runes) dragoon helm multiplier (=2 if helm is chaotic) (edited) Shadowfax88 Legendary Archer 9/26/25, 12:31 PM I'm pretty sure that formula is accurate. The only thing I'm not certain on is if the global crit damage is also applied to it. I'll see if I can find out (edited) Shadowfax88 Legendary Archer 9/26/25, 12:31 PM I'm pretty sure that formula is accurate.

I haven't been able to test meteors because I don't have meteor crit rate enchants 4 1 Follow October 1, 2025 ugh so that means regardless, I'll have to go with thor, maybe get rolla to 6 over a very long time, to drop helix. I guess I answered my own question, other than does griffin do more damage at point blank Shadowfax88 Legendary Archer 10/1/25, 10:01 AM Yes, the base dmg of the claw is higher the closer you are to the enemy extremelyaverage Senior Archer 10/1/25, 10:03 AM i was just curious at what distance is the max damage. but so far, no one knows exactly Ok experimenting a little bit. I have thor 0. I doubt I'll get any higher. I was using ice rune on right. at the expense of the right main weapon rune. This resulted in the freeze triggering while not at an ideal distance. By using rolla instead of thor, freeze usually triggers when I'm within melee range assuming I survive the initial freeze. The main difference without thor is that I'm not point blank with the opponent. Does that matter for damage purposes? DELTADavus Senior Archer 10/1/25, 10:11 AM yeah, thats only \"issue\" you either have early freeze and dont get one shotted, or you dont and have the freeze value on close range, thing is, if you get to close range, you win most likely anyway, regardless of that rolla freeze or not Ok experimenting a little bit.

If we are going for damage, lucky shadow gives 10% elemental crit rate, which seems better at expense of 5% defense loss Shadowfax88 Legendary Archer 10/1/25, 11:01 AM I use lucky shadow but I also run a mixed set with the xbow and dragoon helm/boots with griffin amulet and ring. The majority my damage is elemental and explosion damage so lucky shadow feels like a almost must have for me. With a pure griffin set, I'm not so sure. I think it depends on if you survive easily enough to get close to the opponent. Test out both and see which works better (edited) It also depends if you run elemental crit etched or not Without the elemental crit etched I would probably lean towards guardian but I'm not sure RB773 Mythic Archer 10/1/25, 11:13 AM Why not resilience? Why not resilience? Shadowfax88 Legendary Archer 10/1/25, 11:21 AM I was running resilience for minute but it was definitely not as good as lucky shadow in my build even with a close distance preset. I've haven't done much testing with a full griffin pvp build so I can't say for sure resilience vs guardian but my gut feeling would lean towards guardian (don't make any decisions off this, use at your own risk. ) (edited) 1 extremelyaverage Senior Archer 10/1/25, 11:23 AM yeah I'll just test it. I presume once you get your crit damage up lucky shadow will be better long run Shadowfax88 Legendary Archer 10/1/25, 11:23 AM I just checked the top griffin user in my arena cross server and he uses revive and resilience extremelyaverage Senior Archer 10/1/25, 11:24 AM that could just be a super whale do whatever you want thing though Shadowfax88 Legendary Archer 10/1/25, 11:25 AM Could be.

Debating if i should replace the helm too 1 extremelyaverage Senior Archer 10/1/25, 3:50 PM I guess it depends on how often the oracle ability triggers, and then what your crit rate is. If that results in more than double the shots, then oracle helm is better. Math might change if you are using sprite assist but I doubt you are using that. Wait it would have to be more than double because the helmet increases crit damage by 72%. A crit does 150% at baseline, so a 50% increase in damage, so it would have to be 2.5 times more attacks from the helmet using napkin math. I could be wrong tho (edited) @十ͯ Father Steve | 国语ⷡMͤO̾Dͭ ARC2 I’m about to take that step of making chaotic oracle chest to replace my griffin piece.

AFAICT, potions do not trigger anything besides their effects and it seems to not trigger very often I would think I’d be better off long-term with sprites awe vs. 1/4 matches potion spring triggers I would think I’d be better off long-term with sprites awe vs. 1/4 matches potion spring triggers Shadowfax88 Legendary Archer 9/29/25, 3:37 PM Potion spring has the potential to be a game changer in arena. If you have otta's nian skin at 4 or 5 stars and otta at 2 then the potion spring will proc in the majority of battles. If it happens to proc on invincible pot you can beat people with much higher power. Sprites awe is the more consistent option but potion spring has a significantly higher ceiling For full oracle users swords plus potion spring seems to be working better than double sprite etched in arena as far as I can tell. I'm a mixed set user so I haven't tested it personally but that's what it looks like to me from a distance pimpanzee Junior Archer 9/29/25, 3:42 PM Is it 25% chance to spawn every time I grab a pot!? Why is it great for nian otta? AFAICT, potions do not trigger anything besides their effects and it seems to not trigger very often Exodus the Coach | P90015619 Elite Archer 9/29/25, 3:45 PM Even with what shadow inputed if you're running pots springs on oracle for example nian otta pot triggers every 2 sec lvl it up increases the odds to pots every sec and potion magnet mythic increased you're likely hood for pots springs trigger. Its 1/4 but your chances increased with otta and enchant plus the pots skill if you grab it in arena either way you're still having more value even if it doesn't pop (edited) If does pop you're pretty much winning the round For meteor and strikes builds its pretty much standard (edited) Is it 25% chance to spawn every time I grab a pot!? Shadowfax88 Legendary Archer 9/29/25, 4:01 PM Yes, it does. Like exodus said, it shows up in many pvp/gvg builds. Where it doesn't work well is if you use Thor as a resonance because he moves too much and just runs out of the potion spring range too often pimpanzee Junior Archer 9/29/25, 4:08 PM Well that makes much more sense! The description could be clearer. I thought just 25% of matches it would trigger Thanks the Coach | P90015619 October 1, 2025 Fenrirus Novice Explorer 10/1/25, 8:35 AM Oracle user + Thor + otta costume in gvg i should use aoe and which one etched rune(potion, old sword or maybe new sword)? which one push to legendary first.

Exodus the Coach | P90015619 Elite Archer 10/1/25, 10:26 AM Running strikes on thor is trash because the strikes won't shoot out unless you're facing them which pretty much thor doesn't do often . If you're going strikes thor is useless Aerie ledgendary then pots spring leg. Pots spring leg just gives more potions when it procs.... but i think Aerie first will net you better results in arena Splits is easier to get ledgendary because you have access to it in guildshop but aerie is still better Guild expo Fenrirus Novice Explorer 10/1/25, 10:54 AM Thanks i have frost shock rune with sword enchant and i saw sword dmg in arena.

This is because it prevents someone from sniping you and dropping you in the rankings after you have improved your rankings. And since the arena becomes unplayable 10 minutes before the daily reset, it is recommended to start playing 20-30 minutes before the reset. You could save your tickets and use them all at once on the last day, but I don't know if I would recommend that since you would be wasting 5 tickets each day. Does tickets stack? , , Yes. If you have 0-5 tickets when daily reset, it will reset to 5 tickets. If you have 6 or more, the number won't change. Every day, you can gain 3 more by doing daily tasks, 5 more by buying with gems, 50 more by buying with guild coins. Regarding other modes, ⁠unknown Is there a way to skip the battle? , , The first option is to buy a monthly card. The second option is to press the pause button in the upper left corner right after the battle starts and leave the battle (the result will be reflected). Which build should I use? , , In arena, Dragoon set is recommended. However, many people concentrate on Oracle, so I have created a thread to discuss the rune build for Oracle users. ⁠[Check pinned msg] Arena Build… (edited) 6 Follow EpicJapan | for Help :D ARC2 Chat Mod 4/13/25, 9:30 PM What is the best strategy when I'm stuck in my current group? , , Deliberately demote one level and achieve a higher ranking in that group. Specifically, check the ranking rewards, see if you would earn more if you dropped one group below you, and decide whether to stay in your current group or be demoted. How exactly do I demote myself? , , Keep your equipment off in preset and lower your power. Then play and lose. The way to check the rank to be demoted depends on the group. For those in the Supreme group, it is easy to see that you will be demoted if your ranking is lower than the displayed ranking. For those in the Diamond Master group, multiply the number of people being promoted by 3 and get below that rank. As shown in the picture above, the top 20% are promoted and the bottom 40% are demoted. Since the bottom 40% are below the top 60%, the number of those promoted (20%) should be multiplied by 3.

Even if lucky shadow does boost DPS, the effect is minimal (like 1/5th or 1/10th of what a luck skill would provide) (edited) 2 2 renox Legendary Archer 7/14/25, 6:49 AM For reference, epic lucky shadow boosted Lightwing proc chances from 27% to about 28%, so assuming it scales the same way for xbow, you'd get 2-4% Explo boost (depending on rune rarity) below Mythic xbow, and 3-6% boost for Mythic+. As explo dmg is likely to be 30-50% of all your dps, that's not a significant boost For reference, epic lucky shadow boosted Lightwing proc chances from 27% to about 28%, so assuming it scales the same way for xbow, you'd get 2-4% Explo boost (depending on rune rarity) below Mythic xbow, and 3-6% boost for Mythic+. As explo dmg is likely to be 30-50% of all your dps, that's not a significant boost murvy Legendary Archer 7/14/25, 6:50 AM thanks a lot thought about something like that renox Legendary Archer 7/14/25, 6:50 AM I'd still pick luck skills over strike/sprite/circles though Entropy42 Senior Archer 7/14/25, 10:36 AM What does \"Only front arrows hit without tracking?\" mean? Doesn't the calculator know whether or not you have tracking? renox Legendary Archer 7/14/25, 10:48 AM Not having tracking doesn't equal \"other arrows don't hit\". There is a number of scenarios where all your arrows are hitting even without it. Mostly in seal, which I had in mind when doing this (edited) Entropy42 Senior Archer 7/14/25, 10:49 AM Ah, I understand. The calculator assumes all your extra arrows hit unless that box is checked. Giant Arrow, Sticky Bombs, and the one that gives you damage for killing enemies (Killing Wind?) seem to be missing? I'm using it for Shackled Jungle renox Legendary Archer 7/14/25, 10:52 AM Again, those are missing from seal, and would be kinda hard too keep at full stack at higher chapters. Just guessing isn't an option, so I just excluded it (edited) For bombs and Jungle giant arrow we don't have the numbers, and I doubt someone will test it as the mode isn't hard as long as you meet the requirements, which makes it a low priority (edited) Entropy42 Senior Archer 7/14/25, 11:01 AM This is a really cool tool. Great work. Showed me my intuition was off about how good some abilities are. After using it for a run, the only question I had was why duplicate the check boxes? Couldn't the percentage increases all just be shown on the left side in Column K next to their respective check box? I found myself scrolling back and forth to check the increase and then check the box for whatever I just selected. (edited) renox Legendary Archer 7/14/25, 11:04 AM The idea was to separate skills by rarities as this is how they are offered to you. In this current state, if I removed right side and added percentages to the table, all dupe skill would have to be unfolded into it's own rows Entropy42 Senior Archer 7/14/25, 11:12 AM Ok, but the left side is separated by rarity too. And don't all the dupe skills have the same dps increase (at least for the next one). Your work, your design, just offering some feedback. renox Legendary Archer 7/14/25, 11:12 AM It probably wouldn't be to hard to implement, but I exhausted all my desire for tinkering further while implementing calculations for DoT between attacks Entropy42 Senior Archer 7/14/25, 11:12 AM Hah I think I could implement it in my copy by just dragging those fields over, we'll see (edited) You'Re Viewing Older Messages Jump To Present renox Legendary Archer 7/13/25, 7:31 AM This is my last project for Archero 2, a result of work of about a dozen people over the last 4-6 months.

This will also keep him in close if you are using circle attack/runes. After movement, shoot shoot move. • Second attack is typically jump attack then immediate meteors. If you can get one shot off in between these attacks go for it, but not at the cost of eating a meteor. After the meteors fall, shoot shoot move. • Lastly, you have the flame shot that splits into 6. The triangle method is perfect to avoid this because it may be a charge. Avoid the flame, possibly shoot, move to avoid the flame spread, shoot again.

A rolling bowling boulder attack that eventually splits into 6. The big boulder will also track/follow. , (If this big boulder hits a wall, it will not split and will disappear) A triple rock split. , (Edit) Lastly, he also shoots 5 fast boulders at that are mostly guaranteed hits if you are close to him. , (If you freeze or paralyze him, he will never throw these) • This boss will always throw with his right arm. • My trick is to stand mostly in between him in the center and the wall. This is in the hopes when he tosses the boulder, it will cancel. If it’s the triple rock split you’re still good to go. , • The biggest point is to always rotate to dodge in a counterclockwise direction. This is to have to better chance of dodging the tosses. If you dodge clockwise, you run a much bigger risk of taking a bolder or rock throw. , (edited) Thursday, May 22, 2025 at 7:37 PM 1 1 October 4, 2025 Fluky Senior Archer 10/4/25, 8:52 AM Saturday, October 4, 2025 at 8:52 AM Do griffin ring and helm have a min distance for bonus to activate?

Except in pve content pimpanzee Junior Archer 9/29/25, 3:33 PM Monday, September 29, 2025 at 3:33 PM Why is it great for nian otta? AFAICT, potions do not trigger anything besides their effects and it seems to not trigger very often I would think I’d be better off long-term with sprites awe vs. 1/4 matches potion spring triggers I would think I’d be better off long-term with sprites awe vs. 1/4 matches potion spring triggers Shadowfax88 Legendary Archer 9/29/25, 3:37 PM Monday, September 29, 2025 at 3:37 PM Potion spring has the potential to be a game changer in arena. If you have otta's nian skin at 4 or 5 stars and otta at 2 then the potion spring will proc in the majority of battles. If it happens to proc on invincible pot you can beat people with much higher power. Sprites awe is the more consistent option but potion spring has a significantly higher ceiling For full oracle users swords plus potion spring seems to be working better than double sprite etched in arena as far as I can tell. I'm a mixed set user so I haven't tested it personally but that's what it looks like to me from a distance pimpanzee Junior Archer 9/29/25, 3:42 PM Monday, September 29, 2025 at 3:42 PM Is it 25% chance to spawn every time I grab a pot!? Why is it great for nian otta? AFAICT, potions do not trigger anything besides their effects and it seems to not trigger very often Exodus the Coach | P90015619 Elite Archer 9/29/25, 3:45 PM Monday, September 29, 2025 at 3:45 PM Even with what shadow inputed if you're running pots springs on oracle for example nian otta pot triggers every 2 sec lvl it up increases the odds to pots every sec and potion magnet mythic increased you're likely hood for pots springs trigger. Its 1/4 but your chances increased with otta and enchant plus the pots skill if you grab it in arena either way you're still having more value even if it doesn't pop (edited) Monday, September 29, 2025 at 3:46 PM If does pop you're pretty much winning the round For meteor and strikes builds its pretty much standard (edited) Monday, September 29, 2025 at 3:48 PM Is it 25% chance to spawn every time I grab a pot!? Shadowfax88 Legendary Archer 9/29/25, 4:01 PM Monday, September 29, 2025 at 4:01 PM Yes, it does. Like exodus said, it shows up in many pvp/gvg builds. Where it doesn't work well is if you use Thor as a resonance because he moves too much and just runs out of the potion spring range too often pimpanzee Junior Archer 9/29/25, 4:08 PM Monday, September 29, 2025 at 4:08 PM Well that makes much more sense! The description could be clearer. I thought just 25% of matches it would trigger Thanks the Coach | P90015619 October 1, 2025 Fenrirus Novice Explorer 10/1/25, 8:35 AM Wednesday, October 1, 2025 at 8:35 AM Oracle user + Thor + otta costume in gvg i should use aoe and which one etched rune(potion, old sword or maybe new sword)? which one push to legendary first. (edited) Wednesday, October 1, 2025 at 8:37 AM I think old sword will be the best, but im not sure Oracle user + Thor + otta costume in gvg i should use aoe and which one etched rune(potion, old sword or maybe new sword)? which one push to legendary first. Exodus the Coach | P90015619 Elite Archer 10/1/25, 10:26 AM Wednesday, October 1, 2025 at 10:26 AM Running strikes on thor is trash because the strikes won't shoot out unless you're facing them which pretty much thor doesn't do often . If you're going strikes thor is useless Aerie ledgendary then pots spring leg. Pots spring leg just gives more potions when it procs.... but i think Aerie first will net you better results in arena Splits is easier to get ledgendary because you have access to it in guildshop but aerie is still better Guild expo Fenrirus Novice Explorer 10/1/25, 10:54 AM Wednesday, October 1, 2025 at 10:54 AM Thanks i have frost shock rune with sword enchant and i saw sword dmg in arena.

The majority my damage is elemental and explosion damage so lucky shadow feels like a almost must have for me. With a pure griffin set, I'm not so sure. I think it depends on if you survive easily enough to get close to the opponent. Test out both and see which works better (edited) Wednesday, October 1, 2025 at 11:02 AM It also depends if you run elemental crit etched or not Without the elemental crit etched I would probably lean towards guardian but I'm not sure RB773 Mythic Archer 10/1/25, 11:13 AM Wednesday, October 1, 2025 at 11:13 AM Why not resilience?

Shadowfax88 Legendary Archer 10/1/25, 11:21 AM Wednesday, October 1, 2025 at 11:21 AM I was running resilience for minute but it was definitely not as good as lucky shadow in my build even with a close distance preset. I've haven't done much testing with a full griffin pvp build so I can't say for sure resilience vs guardian but my gut feeling would lean towards guardian (don't make any decisions off this, use at your own risk. ) (edited) Wednesday, October 1, 2025 at 11:21 AM 1 extremelyaverage Senior Archer 10/1/25, 11:23 AM Wednesday, October 1, 2025 at 11:23 AM yeah I'll just test it.

Debating if i should replace the helm too 1 extremelyaverage Senior Archer 10/1/25, 3:50 PM Wednesday, October 1, 2025 at 3:50 PM I guess it depends on how often the oracle ability triggers, and then what your crit rate is. If that results in more than double the shots, then oracle helm is better. Math might change if you are using sprite assist but I doubt you are using that. Wait it would have to be more than double because the helmet increases crit damage by 72%. A crit does 150% at baseline, so a 50% increase in damage, so it would have to be 2.5 times more attacks from the helmet using napkin math.

If it happens to proc on invincible pot you can beat people with much higher power. Sprites awe is the more consistent option but potion spring has a significantly higher ceiling For full oracle users swords plus potion spring seems to be working better than double sprite etched in arena as far as I can tell.

Exodus the Coach | P90015619 Elite Archer 10/1/25, 10:26 AM Wednesday, October 1, 2025 at 10:26 AM Running strikes on thor is trash because the strikes won't shoot out unless you're facing them which pretty much thor doesn't do often . If you're going strikes thor is useless Aerie ledgendary then pots spring leg. Pots spring leg just gives more potions when it procs.... but i think Aerie first will net you better results in arena Splits is easier to get ledgendary because you have access to it in guildshop but aerie is still better Guild expo Fenrirus Novice Explorer 10/1/25, 10:54 AM Wednesday, October 1, 2025 at 10:54 AM Thanks i have frost shock rune with sword enchant and i saw sword dmg in arena. Never thinked about swords doesnt proc with Thor. I know swords hit only enemy on front of hero Leg aerie better than split ? Split generate 5 swords.

This is because it prevents someone from sniping you and dropping you in the rankings after you have improved your rankings. And since the arena becomes unplayable 10 minutes before the daily reset, it is recommended to start playing 20-30 minutes before the reset. You could save your tickets and use them all at once on the last day, but I don't know if I would recommend that since you would be wasting 5 tickets each day. Does tickets stack? , , Yes. If you have 0-5 tickets when daily reset, it will reset to 5 tickets. If you have 6 or more, the number won't change. Every day, you can gain 3 more by doing daily tasks, 5 more by buying with gems, 50 more by buying with guild coins. Regarding other modes, ⁠unknown Is there a way to skip the battle? , , The first option is to buy a monthly card. The second option is to press the pause button in the upper left corner right after the battle starts and leave the battle (the result will be reflected). Which build should I use? , , In arena, Dragoon set is recommended. However, many people concentrate on Oracle, so I have created a thread to discuss the rune build for Oracle users. ⁠[Check pinned msg] Arena Build… (edited) Sunday, June 1, 2025 at 9:26 AM 6 Follow Add this post to your channel list and receive notifications about it. EpicJapan | for Help :D ARC2 Chat Mod 4/13/25, 9:30 PM Sunday, April 13, 2025 at 9:30 PM What is the best strategy when I'm stuck in my current group? , , Deliberately demote one level and achieve a higher ranking in that group. Specifically, check the ranking rewards, see if you would earn more if you dropped one group below you, and decide whether to stay in your current group or be demoted. How exactly do I demote myself? , , Keep your equipment off in preset and lower your power. Then play and lose. The way to check the rank to be demoted depends on the group. For those in the Supreme group, it is easy to see that you will be demoted if your ranking is lower than the displayed ranking. For those in the Diamond Master group, multiply the number of people being promoted by 3 and get below that rank. As shown in the picture above, the top 20% are promoted and the bottom 40% are demoted. Since the bottom 40% are below the top 60%, the number of those promoted (20%) should be multiplied by 3.

Then if you take circles you also deal damage on hit as well as damage over time. The DoT doesn't stack. Super blaze only impacts damage and not the base circle damage 1 Yarfy Junior Archer 9/11/25, 8:51 AM Thursday, September 11, 2025 at 8:51 AM Feel like it would be more fun if the 1.25x dmg was combined with the damage on hit, then you could pick all the skills of the same element and mix and match that way instead of just picking all circles or all sprites etc. But good info to know, thanks EpicJapan | for Help :D ARC2 Chat Mod 5/28/25, 12:03 AM Wednesday, May 28, 2025 at 12:03 AM Updated EpicJapan | for Help :D ARC2 Chat Mod 5/28/25, 12:03 AM Wednesday, May 28, 2025 at 12:03 AM Updated Beth Slobbins ARC2 Senior Archer 5/28/25, 1:44 AM Wednesday, May 28, 2025 at 1:44 AM Does this change front arrow spreadsheet?

Even if lucky shadow does boost DPS, the effect is minimal (like 1/5th or 1/10th of what a luck skill would provide) (edited) Monday, July 14, 2025 at 6:31 AM 2 2 renox Legendary Archer 7/14/25, 6:49 AM Monday, July 14, 2025 at 6:49 AM For reference, epic lucky shadow boosted Lightwing proc chances from 27% to about 28%, so assuming it scales the same way for xbow, you'd get 2-4% Explo boost (depending on rune rarity) below Mythic xbow, and 3-6% boost for Mythic+. As explo dmg is likely to be 30-50% of all your dps, that's not a significant boost For reference, epic lucky shadow boosted Lightwing proc chances from 27% to about 28%, so assuming it scales the same way for xbow, you'd get 2-4% Explo boost (depending on rune rarity) below Mythic xbow, and 3-6% boost for Mythic+.

Doesn't the calculator know whether or not you have tracking? renox Legendary Archer 7/14/25, 10:48 AM Monday, July 14, 2025 at 10:48 AM Not having tracking doesn't equal \"other arrows don't hit\". There is a number of scenarios where all your arrows are hitting even without it. Mostly in seal, which I had in mind when doing this (edited) Monday, July 14, 2025 at 10:48 AM Entropy42 Senior Archer 7/14/25, 10:49 AM Monday, July 14, 2025 at 10:49 AM Ah, I understand. The calculator assumes all your extra arrows hit unless that box is checked. Giant Arrow, Sticky Bombs, and the one that gives you damage for killing enemies (Killing Wind?) seem to be missing? I'm using it for Shackled Jungle renox Legendary Archer 7/14/25, 10:52 AM Monday, July 14, 2025 at 10:52 AM Again, those are missing from seal, and would be kinda hard too keep at full stack at higher chapters. Just guessing isn't an option, so I just excluded it (edited) Monday, July 14, 2025 at 10:58 AM For bombs and Jungle giant arrow we don't have the numbers, and I doubt someone will test it as the mode isn't hard as long as you meet the requirements, which makes it a low priority (edited) Monday, July 14, 2025 at 10:55 AM Entropy42 Senior Archer 7/14/25, 11:01 AM Monday, July 14, 2025 at 11:01 AM This is a really cool tool. Great work. Showed me my intuition was off about how good some abilities are. After using it for a run, the only question I had was why duplicate the check boxes? Couldn't the percentage increases all just be shown on the left side in Column K next to their respective check box? I found myself scrolling back and forth to check the increase and then check the box for whatever I just selected. (edited) Monday, July 14, 2025 at 11:01 AM renox Legendary Archer 7/14/25, 11:04 AM Monday, July 14, 2025 at 11:04 AM The idea was to separate skills by rarities as this is how they are offered to you. In this current state, if I removed right side and added percentages to the table, all dupe skill would have to be unfolded into it's own rows Entropy42 Senior Archer 7/14/25, 11:12 AM Monday, July 14, 2025 at 11:12 AM Ok, but the left side is separated by rarity too. And don't all the dupe skills have the same dps increase (at least for the next one). Your work, your design, just offering some feedback. renox Legendary Archer 7/14/25, 11:12 AM Monday, July 14, 2025 at 11:12 AM It probably wouldn't be to hard to implement, but I exhausted all my desire for tinkering further while implementing calculations for DoT between attacks Entropy42 Senior Archer 7/14/25, 11:12 AM Monday, July 14, 2025 at 11:12 AM Hah I think I could implement it in my copy by just dragging those fields over, we'll see (edited) Monday, July 14, 2025 at 11:13 AM You'Re Viewing Older Messages Jump To Present renox Legendary Archer 7/13/25, 7:31 AM Sunday, July 13, 2025 at 7:31 AM This is my last project for Archero 2, a result of work of about a dozen people over the last 4-6 months.

I would think no because sprites inherit owner's crit rate I think would refer to global crit rate extremelyaverage Senior Archer 10/3/25, 12:24 PM yeah assist 2.

So global crit would be your base+ artifacts and does not include weapon crit or characters? And I get that we wont know until someone physically tries it Shadowfax88 Legendary Archer 10/3/25, 12:37 PM It's confusing because some things in the game are not worded properly. Anything that says crit +% with no specific damage type modifiers in front of it are typically considered to be global crit and anything that says \"inherit character/owner crit\" would use this number. The exceptions to this are oracle boots, spear, griffin helm and otta 2 which are all worded in a way that would imply global crit but what they really mean are main weapon crit (edited) Rolla's passive, on the other hand, is a global crit multiplier extremelyaverage Senior Archer 10/3/25, 12:38 PM as is otta's passive? Shadowfax88 Legendary Archer 10/3/25, 12:38 PM My guess is that's global crit rate but I'm not positive on that extremelyaverage Senior Archer 10/3/25, 12:39 PM its all insane, and I half expect them to change something at some point unintentionally and then it will have to figured out again.

The explosive meteor damage itself only crits if you have the meteor crit rate enchantment The base 5% crit rate is considered global crit rate. This impacts main weapon, sword strikes and non-explosive meteors. Elemental base crit rate is determined by luck. If you run lucky shadow, I believe the base rate is 10%. This can be increased by elemental crit rate +% enchants on runes and the elemental crit etched. All other (circles, sprites and explosive meteors) have a base crit of 0%. These can only be increased by their specific crit rate +% enchants (except for circles if you have mythic sawblade where circles inherit main weapon crit) Explosions never crit (for example... xbow explosion on hit and other dragoon gear",

Debating if i should replace the helm too 1 extremelyaverage Senior Archer 10/1/25, 3:50 PM I guess it depends on how often the oracle ability triggers, and then what your crit rate is. If that results in more than double the shots, then oracle helm is better. Math might change if you are using sprite assist but I doubt you are using that. Wait it would have to be more than double because the helmet increases crit damage by 72%. A crit does 150% at baseline, so a 50% increase in damage, so it would have to be 2.5 times more attacks from the helmet using napkin math. I could be wrong tho (edited) @十ͯ Father Steve | 国语ⷡMͤO̾Dͭ ARC2 I’m about to take that step of making chaotic oracle chest to replace my griffin piece.

This is because it prevents someone from sniping you and dropping you in the rankings after you have improved your rankings. And since the arena becomes unplayable 10 minutes before the daily reset, it is recommended to start playing 20-30 minutes before the reset.

Except in pve content Arena Tips & FAQ Game Modes April 13, 2025 EpicJapan | for Help :D ARC2 Chat Mod 4/13/25, 9:22 PM Sunday, April 13, 2025 at 9:22 PM If you have other arena questions, feel free to ask here , What time should I play Arena every day? , , I recommend 20-30 minutes before the daily reset. This is because it prevents someone from sniping you and dropping you in the rankings after you have improved your rankings. And since the arena becomes unplayable 10 minutes before the daily reset, it is recommended to start playing 20-30 minutes before the reset. You could save your tickets and use them all at once on the last day, but I don't know if I would recommend that since you would be wasting 5 tickets each day. Does tickets stack? , , Yes. If you have 0-5 tickets when daily reset, it will reset to 5 tickets. If you have 6 or more, the number won't change. Every day, you can gain 3 more by doing daily tasks, 5 more by buying with gems, 50 more by buying with guild coins. Regarding other modes, ⁠unknown Is there a way to skip the battle? , , The first option is to buy a monthly card. The second option is to press the pause button in the upper left corner right after the battle starts and leave the battle (the result will be reflected). Which build should I use? , , In arena, Dragoon set is recommended. However, many people concentrate on Oracle, so I have created a thread to discuss the rune build for Oracle users. ⁠[Check pinned msg] Arena Build… (edited) Sunday, June 1, 2025 at 9:26 AM 6 Follow Add this post to your channel list and receive notifications about it. EpicJapan | for Help :D ARC2 Chat Mod 4/13/25, 9:30 PM Sunday, April 13, 2025 at 9:30 PM What is the best strategy when I'm stuck in my current group? , , Deliberately demote one level and achieve a higher ranking in that group. Specifically, check the ranking rewards, see if you would earn more if you dropped one group below you, and decide whether to stay in your current group or be demoted. How exactly do I demote myself? , , Keep your equipment off in preset and lower your power. Then play and lose. The way to check the rank to be demoted depends on the group. For those in the Supreme group, it is easy to see that you will be demoted if your ranking is lower than the displayed ranking. For those in the Diamond Master group, multiply the number of people being promoted by 3 and get below that rank. As shown in the picture above, the top 20% are promoted and the bottom 40% are demoted. Since the bottom 40% are below the top 60%, the number of those promoted (20%) should be multiplied by 3.

Debating if i should replace the helm too 1 extremelyaverage Senior Archer 10/1/25, 3:50 PM Wednesday, October 1, 2025 at 3:50 PM I guess it depends on how often the oracle ability triggers, and then what your crit rate is. If that results in more than double the shots, then oracle helm is better. Math might change if you are using sprite assist but I doubt you are using that. Wait it would have to be more than double because the helmet increases crit damage by 72%. A crit does 150% at baseline, so a 50% increase in damage, so it would have to be 2.5 times more attacks from the helmet using napkin math.
