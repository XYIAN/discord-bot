(Same direction as circles) • For now, not sure of a better way to avoid attacks other than hope he spins and lands farther away from you to; first, dodge the charge, then dodge his shots. After shooting, he pretty much preps his charge again. • Think the only solid hope is freezes, shields, and something auto attack like circles since he’s always close range from charging.

This will also keep him in close if you are using circle attack/runes. After movement, shoot shoot move. • Second attack is typically jump attack then immediate meteors. If you can get one shot off in between these attacks go for it, but not at the cost of eating a meteor. After the meteors fall, shoot shoot move. • Lastly, you have the flame shot that splits into 6. The triangle method is perfect to avoid this because it may be a charge. Avoid the flame, possibly shoot, move to avoid the flame spread, shoot again. Rinse and repeat ARC2 Flame Demon • This boss will have 3 different attacks: 3x charges. , Jump charge followed immediately by random falling meteors. , Flame Shoot attack that will split into 6 smaller flames that spread outward.

A rolling bowling boulder attack that eventually splits into 6. The big boulder will also track/follow. , (If this big boulder hits a wall, it will not split and will disappear) A triple rock split. , (Edit) Lastly, he also shoots 5 fast boulders at that are mostly guaranteed hits if you are close to him. , (If you freeze or paralyze him, he will never throw these) • This boss will always throw with his right arm. • My trick is to stand mostly in between him in the center and the wall. This is in the hopes when he tosses the boulder, it will cancel. If it’s the triple rock split you’re still good to go. , • The biggest point is to always rotate to dodge in a counterclockwise direction. This is to have to better chance of dodging the tosses. If you dodge clockwise, you run a much bigger risk of taking a bolder or rock throw. , (edited) 1 1 ARC2 Stone Golem • This boss has 3 different attacks.

Been stuck on reaper mage until I found this guide ^.^ EasyVictor ARC2 Senior Archer 6/5/25, 8:40 AM Let me know if you have any other trouble, I can write more guides if not already posted here. Happy to help the community. I only really have trouble with the spinning flowers. Not sure how to fully 'dodge' them at a lower level. The higher power (quicker you kill them) it's not a big deal because you kill them fast enough. And also the Scythe Mages... Stay away from the walls really and dodge the bounces. Princess Nyxx 6/5/25, 8:48 AM I always move counter clockwise on the spinning flowers. So if it's at 12oclock, I position at 9 and move to 6. It will then move to 6 o'clock and I move to 3.

A rolling bowling boulder attack that eventually splits into 6. The big boulder will also track/follow. , (If this big boulder hits a wall, it will not split and will disappear) A triple rock split. , (Edit) Lastly, he also shoots 5 fast boulders at that are mostly guaranteed hits if you are close to him. , (If you freeze or paralyze him, he will never throw these) • This boss will always throw with his right arm. • My trick is to stand mostly in between him in the center and the wall. This is in the hopes when he tosses the boulder, it will cancel. If it’s the triple rock split you’re still good to go. , • The biggest point is to always rotate to dodge in a counterclockwise direction. This is to have to better chance of dodging the tosses. If you dodge clockwise, you run a much bigger risk of taking a bolder or rock throw. , (edited) 1 1 September 30, 2025 My pve set is xbow, oracle amulet, griffin ring, oracle chest, dragoon helm, oracle boots (all M0-M2) frog Senior Archer 9/30/25, 5:21 PM What a My pve set is xbow, oracle amulet, griffin ring, oracle chest, dragoon helm, oracle boots (all M0-M2) MX4 Novice Explorer 9/30/25, 6:20 PM Can I ask why griffin ring with xbow?

After shooting, he pretty much preps his charge again. • Think the only solid hope is freezes, shields, and something auto attack like circles since he’s always close range from charging.

This will also keep him in close if you are using circle attack/runes. After movement, shoot shoot move. • Second attack is typically jump attack then immediate meteors. If you can get one shot off in between these attacks go for it, but not at the cost of eating a meteor. After the meteors fall, shoot shoot move. • Lastly, you have the flame shot that splits into 6. The triangle method is perfect to avoid this because it may be a charge. Avoid the flame, possibly shoot, move to avoid the flame spread, shoot again.

This is in the hopes when he tosses the boulder, it will cancel. If it’s the triple rock split you’re still good to go. , • The biggest point is to always rotate to dodge in a counterclockwise direction. This is to have to better chance of dodging the tosses. If you dodge clockwise, you run a much bigger risk of taking a bolder or rock throw. , (edited) 1 1 ARC2 Stone Golem • This boss has 3 different attacks.

After shooting, he pretty much preps his charge again. • Think the only solid hope is freezes, shields, and something auto attack like circles since he’s always close range from charging.

This will also keep him in close if you are using circle attack/runes. After movement, shoot shoot move. • Second attack is typically jump attack then immediate meteors. If you can get one shot off in between these attacks go for it, but not at the cost of eating a meteor. After the meteors fall, shoot shoot move. • Lastly, you have the flame shot that splits into 6.

A rolling bowling boulder attack that eventually splits into 6. The big boulder will also track/follow. , (If this big boulder hits a wall, it will not split and will disappear) A triple rock split. , (Edit) Lastly, he also shoots 5 fast boulders at that are mostly guaranteed hits if you are close to him. , (If you freeze or paralyze him, he will never throw these) • This boss will always throw with his right arm. • My trick is to stand mostly in between him in the center and the wall. This is in the hopes when he tosses the boulder, it will cancel. If it’s the triple rock split you’re still good to go. , • The biggest point is to always rotate to dodge in a counterclockwise direction. This is to have to better chance of dodging the tosses. If you dodge clockwise, you run a much bigger risk of taking a bolder or rock throw. , (edited) 1 1 September 30, 2025 My pve set is xbow, oracle amulet, griffin ring, oracle chest, dragoon helm, oracle boots (all M0-M2) frog Senior Archer 9/30/25, 5:21 PM What a My pve set is xbow, oracle amulet, griffin ring, oracle chest, dragoon helm, oracle boots (all M0-M2) MX4 Novice Explorer 9/30/25, 6:20 PM Can I ask why griffin ring with xbow?

After shooting, he pretty much preps his charge again. • Think the only solid hope is freezes, shields, and something auto attack like circles since he’s always close range from charging.

If you can get one shot off in between these attacks go for it, but not at the cost of eating a meteor. After the meteors fall, shoot shoot move. • Lastly, you have the flame shot that splits into 6.

Specifically, check the ranking rewards, see if you would earn more if you dropped one group below you, and decide whether to stay in your current group or be demoted. How exactly do I demote myself? , , Keep your equipment off in preset and lower your power. Then play and lose. The way to check the rank to be demoted depends on the group. For those in the Supreme group, it is easy to see that you will be demoted if your ranking is lower than the displayed ranking. For those in the Diamond Master group, multiply the number of people being promoted by 3 and get below that rank. As shown in the picture above, the top 20% are promoted and the bottom 40% are demoted. Since the bottom 40% are below the top 60%, the number of those promoted (20%) should be multiplied by 3.

EpicJapan | for Help :D ARC2 Chat Mod 4/13/25, 9:30 PM Sunday, April 13, 2025 at 9:30 PM What is the best strategy when I'm stuck in my current group? , , Deliberately demote one level and achieve a higher ranking in that group. Specifically, check the ranking rewards, see if you would earn more if you dropped one group below you, and decide whether to stay in your current group or be demoted. How exactly do I demote myself? , , Keep your equipment off in preset and lower your power. Then play and lose. The way to check the rank to be demoted depends on the group. For those in the Supreme group, it is easy to see that you will be demoted if your ranking is lower than the displayed ranking. For those in the Diamond Master group, multiply the number of people being promoted by 3 and get below that rank. As shown in the picture above, the top 20% are promoted and the bottom 40% are demoted. Since the bottom 40% are below the top 60%, the number of those promoted (20%) should be multiplied by 3.

Specifically, check the ranking rewards, see if you would earn more if you dropped one group below you, and decide whether to stay in your current group or be demoted. How exactly do I demote myself? , , Keep your equipment off in preset and lower your power. Then play and lose. The way to check the rank to be demoted depends on the group. For those in the Supreme group, it is easy to see that you will be demoted if your ranking is lower than the displayed ranking. For those in the Diamond Master group, multiply the number of people being promoted by 3 and get below that rank. As shown in the picture above, the top 20% are promoted and the bottom 40% are demoted. Since the bottom 40% are below the top 60%, the number of those promoted (20%) should be multiplied by 3.
