September 26, 2025 meteor is also impact by elemental dmg right? as it has different elements too Shadowfax88 Legendary Archer 9/26/25, 10:34 AM Yes, meteors cause supplemental elemental damage. The elemental damage aspect can crit if you have lucky shadow. The explosive meteor damage itself only crits if you have the meteor crit rate enchantment The base 5% crit rate is considered global crit rate. This impacts main weapon, sword strikes and non-explosive meteors. Elemental base crit rate is determined by luck. If you run lucky shadow, I believe the base rate is 10%. This can be increased by elemental crit rate +% enchants on runes and the elemental crit etched. All other (circles, sprites and explosive meteors) have a base crit of 0%. These can only be increased by their specific crit rate +% enchants (except for circles if you have mythic sawblade where circles inherit main weapon crit) Explosions never crit (for example... xbow explosion on hit and other dragoon gear) Awesomethanu Senior Archer 9/26/25, 12:00 PM back to this, it is the same for crit dmg right? if i use xbow with meteor and i have meteor crit rate enchant but dont have meteor crit dmg, does the normal crit dmg applies? or same as crit rate, normal crit dmg works on MW, SWORD STRIKES AND NON EXPLOSIVE METOERS? back to this, it is the same for crit dmg right? if i use xbow with meteor and i have meteor crit rate enchant but dont have meteor crit dmg, does the normal crit dmg applies? Shadowfax88 Legendary Archer 9/26/25, 12:14 PM I'm not positive on this but I'm pretty sure crit damage calculation works like this. All sources of damage that are able to crit have a base crit damage of +50% and additional crit damage is additive to that. Global crit damage works the same way as global crit rate (it only effects main weapon, swords and non explosive meteors). At least this is my understanding but I'm not positive. If you have an enchant for meteor crit damage +30% and that meteor crits it will end up doing 180% damage. I believe the calculation is for explosive meteors is this. Explosive meteor damage (1.25x atk) (explosion multiplier (=3 from xbow) + crit damage multiplier) meteor multiplier (from left side meteor runes) dragoon helm multiplier (=2 if helm is chaotic) (edited) Shadowfax88 Legendary Archer 9/26/25, 12:31 PM I'm pretty sure that formula is accurate. The only thing I'm not certain on is if the global crit damage is also applied to it. I'll see if I can find out (edited) Shadowfax88 Legendary Archer 9/26/25, 12:47 PM I can confirm that elements that crit only use the elemental crit damage multiplier (unless you have the elemental crit etched that allows them to inherit % of character crit). I haven't been able to test meteors because I don't have meteor crit rate enchants Awesomethanu Senior Archer 9/26/25, 12:47 PM how do u do the test i have meteor crit rate but low rate Shadowfax88 Legendary Archer 9/26/25, 12:50 PM By unequiping everything except for runes/gear that have the variables you are testing for and then doing practice runs in seal or invasion. Turn on damage numbers. Meteors are a little harder to test because they also apply elemental damage so the screen gets a little more clogged but is possible Awesomethanu Senior Archer 9/26/25, 1:04 PM It seems like it does. Trying to send you the video Not sure if I done it correctly though File is too big to send Is this crit? Shadowfax88 Legendary Archer 9/26/25, 1:10 PM Yes, that is a crit. But I just got confirmation that explosive meteors that crit just use meteor crit damage multiplier from enchants and not global crit rate Are you sure there were no other variables in your test that may have impacted overall damage numbers? Awesomethanu Senior Archer 9/26/25, 1:17 PM I don’t have any meteor crit dmg enchantments Shadowfax88 Legendary Archer 9/26/25, 1:19 PM That crit damage could be coming from another source then. Such as the xbow attack Plus the base crit damage for explosive meteors is +50% even if you don't have any other ones. The meteor crit damage enchants are additive to that Awesomethanu Senior Archer 9/26/25, 1:21 PM I’m moving towards wall to refrain myself from attacking all the time. Not sure if I slipped my fingers or not but I think most of the time I didn’t. Who are you getting the information from ? Shadowfax88 Legendary Archer 9/26/25, 1:22 PM People in the vip chat who have both tested and asked devs Awesomethanu Senior Archer 9/26/25, 1:22 PM Ok cool Since more like it then So In short if u only had meteor crit rate it is pointless to use it without meteor crit dmg. For those with explosion dmg Shadowfax88 Legendary Archer 9/26/25, 1:42 PM You can still use meteor crit rate because of the base crit damage multiplier Yes, that is a crit. But I just got confirmation that explosive meteors that crit just use meteor crit damage multiplier from enchants and not global crit rate TodoNuDeMeias Senior Archer 9/26/25, 2:29 PM So in this case meteors would do 130% if we had a crit enchant of +30%?

I would think no because sprites inherit owner's crit rate I think would refer to global crit rate extremelyaverage Senior Archer 10/3/25, 12:24 PM yeah assist 2.

So global crit would be your base+ artifacts and does not include weapon crit or characters? And I get that we wont know until someone physically tries it Shadowfax88 Legendary Archer 10/3/25, 12:37 PM It's confusing because some things in the game are not worded properly. Anything that says crit +% with no specific damage type modifiers in front of it are typically considered to be global crit and anything that says \"inherit character/owner crit\" would use this number. The exceptions to this are oracle boots, spear, griffin helm and otta 2 which are all worded in a way that would imply global crit but what they really mean are main weapon crit (edited) Rolla's passive, on the other hand, is a global crit multiplier extremelyaverage Senior Archer 10/3/25, 12:38 PM as is otta's passive?

All other (circles, sprites and explosive meteors) have a base crit of 0%. These can only be increased by their specific crit rate +% enchants (except for circles if you have mythic sawblade where circles inherit main weapon crit) Explosions never crit (for example... xbow explosion on hit and other dragoon gear) Awesomethanu Senior Archer 9/26/25, 12:00 PM back to this, it is the same for crit dmg right? if i use xbow with meteor and i have meteor crit rate enchant but dont have meteor crit dmg, does the normal crit dmg applies?

Shadowfax88 Legendary Archer 9/26/25, 12:14 PM I'm not positive on this but I'm pretty sure crit damage calculation works like this. All sources of damage that are able to crit have a base crit damage of +50% and additional crit damage is additive to that. Global crit damage works the same way as global crit rate (it only effects main weapon, swords and non explosive meteors). At least this is my understanding but I'm not positive.

I guess I answered my own question, other than does griffin do more damage at point blank Shadowfax88 Legendary Archer 10/1/25, 10:01 AM Yes, the base dmg of the claw is higher the closer you are to the enemy extremelyaverage Senior Archer 10/1/25, 10:03 AM i was just curious at what distance is the max damage. but so far, no one knows exactly Ok experimenting a little bit. I have thor 0. I doubt I'll get any higher. I was using ice rune on right. at the expense of the right main weapon rune. This resulted in the freeze triggering while not at an ideal distance. By using rolla instead of thor, freeze usually triggers when I'm within melee range assuming I survive the initial freeze. The main difference without thor is that I'm not point blank with the opponent. Does that matter for damage purposes? DELTADavus Senior Archer 10/1/25, 10:11 AM yeah, thats only \"issue\" you either have early freeze and dont get one shotted, or you dont and have the freeze value on close range, thing is, if you get to close range, you win most likely anyway, regardless of that rolla freeze or not Ok experimenting a little bit.

If we are going for damage, lucky shadow gives 10% elemental crit rate, which seems better at expense of 5% defense loss Shadowfax88 Legendary Archer 10/1/25, 11:01 AM I use lucky shadow but I also run a mixed set with the xbow and dragoon helm/boots with griffin amulet and ring. The majority my damage is elemental and explosion damage so lucky shadow feels like a almost must have for me. With a pure griffin set, I'm not so sure. I think it depends on if you survive easily enough to get close to the opponent. Test out both and see which works better (edited) It also depends if you run elemental crit etched or not Without the elemental crit etched I would probably lean towards guardian but I'm not sure RB773 Mythic Archer 10/1/25, 11:13 AM Why not resilience? Why not resilience? Shadowfax88 Legendary Archer 10/1/25, 11:21 AM I was running resilience for minute but it was definitely not as good as lucky shadow in my build even with a close distance preset. I've haven't done much testing with a full griffin pvp build so I can't say for sure resilience vs guardian but my gut feeling would lean towards guardian (don't make any decisions off this, use at your own risk. ) (edited) 1 extremelyaverage Senior Archer 10/1/25, 11:23 AM yeah I'll just test it. I presume once you get your crit damage up lucky shadow will be better long run Shadowfax88 Legendary Archer 10/1/25, 11:23 AM I just checked the top griffin user in my arena cross server and he uses revive and resilience extremelyaverage Senior Archer 10/1/25, 11:24 AM that could just be a super whale do whatever you want thing though Shadowfax88 Legendary Archer 10/1/25, 11:25 AM Could be.

Debating if i should replace the helm too 1 extremelyaverage Senior Archer 10/1/25, 3:50 PM I guess it depends on how often the oracle ability triggers, and then what your crit rate is. If that results in more than double the shots, then oracle helm is better. Math might change if you are using sprite assist but I doubt you are using that. Wait it would have to be more than double because the helmet increases crit damage by 72%. A crit does 150% at baseline, so a 50% increase in damage, so it would have to be 2.5 times more attacks from the helmet using napkin math. I could be wrong tho (edited) @十ͯ Father Steve | 国语ⷡMͤO̾Dͭ ARC2 I’m about to take that step of making chaotic oracle chest to replace my griffin piece.

If that results in more than double the shots, then oracle helm is better. Math might change if you are using sprite assist but I doubt you are using that. Wait it would have to be more than double because the helmet increases crit damage by 72%. A crit does 150% at baseline, so a 50% increase in damage, so it would have to be 2.5 times more attacks from the helmet using napkin math.
