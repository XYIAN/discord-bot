It's +3% dmg of the particular dmg source of the etched rune for each skill of that type taken. Zero benefit in gvg and peak because no skills are available.

(Same direction as circles) • For now, not sure of a better way to avoid attacks other than hope he spins and lands farther away from you to; first, dodge the charge, then dodge his shots. After shooting, he pretty much preps his charge again. • Think the only solid hope is freezes, shields, and something auto attack like circles since he’s always close range from charging.

This will also keep him in close if you are using circle attack/runes. After movement, shoot shoot move. • Second attack is typically jump attack then immediate meteors. If you can get one shot off in between these attacks go for it, but not at the cost of eating a meteor. After the meteors fall, shoot shoot move. • Lastly, you have the flame shot that splits into 6. The triangle method is perfect to avoid this because it may be a charge. Avoid the flame, possibly shoot, move to avoid the flame spread, shoot again.

This is in the hopes when he tosses the boulder, it will cancel. If it’s the triple rock split you’re still good to go. , • The biggest point is to always rotate to dodge in a counterclockwise direction. This is to have to better chance of dodging the tosses.

September 26, 2025 meteor is also impact by elemental dmg right? as it has different elements too Shadowfax88 Legendary Archer 9/26/25, 10:34 AM Yes, meteors cause supplemental elemental damage. The elemental damage aspect can crit if you have lucky shadow. The explosive meteor damage itself only crits if you have the meteor crit rate enchantment The base 5% crit rate is considered global crit rate.

Shadowfax88 Legendary Archer 9/26/25, 12:14 PM I'm not positive on this but I'm pretty sure crit damage calculation works like this. All sources of damage that are able to crit have a base crit damage of +50% and additional crit damage is additive to that. Global crit damage works the same way as global crit rate (it only effects main weapon, swords and non explosive meteors). At least this is my understanding but I'm not positive. If you have an enchant for meteor crit damage +30% and that meteor crits it will end up doing 180% damage. I believe the calculation is for explosive meteors is this.

The only thing I'm not certain on is if the global crit damage is also applied to it. I'll see if I can find out (edited) Shadowfax88 Legendary Archer 9/26/25, 12:47 PM I can confirm that elements that crit only use the elemental crit damage multiplier (unless you have the elemental crit etched that allows them to inherit % of character crit). I haven't been able to test meteors because I don't have meteor crit rate enchants Awesomethanu Senior Archer 9/26/25, 12:47 PM how do u do the test i have meteor crit rate but low rate Shadowfax88 Legendary Archer 9/26/25, 12:50 PM By unequiping everything except for runes/gear that have the variables you are testing for and then doing practice runs in seal or invasion. Turn on damage numbers. Meteors are a little harder to test because they also apply elemental damage so the screen gets a little more clogged but is possible Awesomethanu Senior Archer 9/26/25, 1:04 PM It seems like it does. Trying to send you the video Not sure if I done it correctly though File is too big to send Is this crit? Shadowfax88 Legendary Archer 9/26/25, 1:10 PM Yes, that is a crit. But I just got confirmation that explosive meteors that crit just use meteor crit damage multiplier from enchants and not global crit rate Are you sure there were no other variables in your test that may have impacted overall damage numbers? Awesomethanu Senior Archer 9/26/25, 1:17 PM I don’t have any meteor crit dmg enchantments Shadowfax88 Legendary Archer 9/26/25, 1:19 PM That crit damage could be coming from another source then. Such as the xbow attack Plus the base crit damage for explosive meteors is +50% even if you don't have any other ones. The meteor crit damage enchants are additive to that Awesomethanu Senior Archer 9/26/25, 1:21 PM I’m moving towards wall to refrain myself from attacking all the time. Not sure if I slipped my fingers or not but I think most of the time I didn’t. Who are you getting the information from ? Shadowfax88 Legendary Archer 9/26/25, 1:22 PM People in the vip chat who have both tested and asked devs Awesomethanu Senior Archer 9/26/25, 1:22 PM Ok cool Since more like it then So In short if u only had meteor crit rate it is pointless to use it without meteor crit dmg. For those with explosion dmg Shadowfax88 Legendary Archer 9/26/25, 1:42 PM You can still use meteor crit rate because of the base crit damage multiplier Yes, that is a crit. But I just got confirmation that explosive meteors that crit just use meteor crit damage multiplier from enchants and not global crit rate TodoNuDeMeias Senior Archer 9/26/25, 2:29 PM So in this case meteors would do 130% if we had a crit enchant of +30%? Never mind , saw that you replied after mentioning that explosive meteors rate is +50% , so i assume the meteor crit damage would be 80%?

I would think no because sprites inherit owner's crit rate I think would refer to global crit rate extremelyaverage Senior Archer 10/3/25, 12:24 PM yeah assist 2. So global crit would be your base+ artifacts and does not include weapon crit or characters? And I get that we wont know until someone physically tries it does that include rune enchantments? yeah assist 2. So global crit would be your base+ artifacts and does not include weapon crit or characters? And I get that we wont know until someone physically tries it Shadowfax88 Legendary Archer 10/3/25, 12:37 PM It's confusing because some things in the game are not worded properly. Anything that says crit +% with no specific damage type modifiers in front of it are typically considered to be global crit and anything that says \"inherit character/owner crit\" would use this number. The exceptions to this are oracle boots, spear, griffin helm and otta 2 which are all worded in a way that would imply global crit but what they really mean are main weapon crit (edited) Rolla's passive, on the other hand, is a global crit multiplier extremelyaverage Senior Archer 10/3/25, 12:38 PM as is otta's passive? Shadowfax88 Legendary Archer 10/3/25, 12:38 PM My guess is that's global crit rate but I'm not positive on that extremelyaverage Senior Archer 10/3/25, 12:39 PM its all insane, and I half expect them to change something at some point unintentionally and then it will have to figured out again.

I have thor 0. I doubt I'll get any higher. I was using ice rune on right. at the expense of the right main weapon rune. This resulted in the freeze triggering while not at an ideal distance.

If we are going for damage, lucky shadow gives 10% elemental crit rate, which seems better at expense of 5% defense loss Shadowfax88 Legendary Archer 10/1/25, 11:01 AM I use lucky shadow but I also run a mixed set with the xbow and dragoon helm/boots with griffin amulet and ring. The majority my damage is elemental and explosion damage so lucky shadow feels like a almost must have for me. With a pure griffin set, I'm not so sure. I think it depends on if you survive easily enough to get close to the opponent. Test out both and see which works better (edited) It also depends if you run elemental crit etched or not Without the elemental crit etched I would probably lean towards guardian but I'm not sure RB773 Mythic Archer 10/1/25, 11:13 AM Why not resilience? Why not resilience? Shadowfax88 Legendary Archer 10/1/25, 11:21 AM I was running resilience for minute but it was definitely not as good as lucky shadow in my build even with a close distance preset. I've haven't done much testing with a full griffin pvp build so I can't say for sure resilience vs guardian but my gut feeling would lean towards guardian (don't make any decisions off this, use at your own risk. ) (edited) 1 extremelyaverage Senior Archer 10/1/25, 11:23 AM yeah I'll just test it.

Debating if i should replace the helm too 1 extremelyaverage Senior Archer 10/1/25, 3:50 PM I guess it depends on how often the oracle ability triggers, and then what your crit rate is. If that results in more than double the shots, then oracle helm is better. Math might change if you are using sprite assist but I doubt you are using that. Wait it would have to be more than double because the helmet increases crit damage by 72%. A crit does 150% at baseline, so a 50% increase in damage, so it would have to be 2.5 times more attacks from the helmet using napkin math.

I'm doing all the things you note and often not even reaching the final boss. I can show you a video if you like. tea🍵 Archer Booster 8/17/25, 10:39 AM ur rune build has both sprite and circles go for circles only Entropy42 Senior Archer 8/17/25, 10:40 AM the left one is my best runes in terms of rating. I use the right set for Shackled tea🍵 Archer Booster 8/17/25, 10:40 AM Sprites not viable unless you have Legendary Sprite's Awe maybe it is but circles is much better an example of circles build for shackled jungle Entropy42 Senior Archer 8/17/25, 10:45 AM I was using sprites because the bosses always kill me and the sprites can shoot them when they are at range. Other people here had recommended that build, but I've swapped between legendary AoE etched and an Epic+1 sprites awe rune. I've tried circles before and still failed, but I'll try circles again, what I'm doing now doesn't work anyway. Thanks. murvy Legendary Archer 8/17/25, 10:45 AM Circles wont work as good as AWE even if AWE is only at epic I was using sprites because the bosses always kill me and the sprites can shoot them when they are at range.

I've tried circles before and still failed, but I'll try circles again, what I'm doing now doesn't work anyway. Thanks. murvy Legendary Archer 8/17/25, 10:46 AM Dont waste your time on it. I accidently equiped a L1 blessing resilience since then i cant beat shakles anymore (edited) Neither equiped with it nor without it equiped. The game mode is just poorly designed Starting to hit on L2 runes didnt helped either Entropy42 Senior Archer 8/17/25, 10:59 AM I used to be able to swap between aoe and awe and beat the levels, been stuck at 121 for a while I don't understand what you mean. Entering the jungle screen is the only way to see your rating anyway, so this is how it has always been. Mahoney | P90015575 Elite Archer 8/17/25, 10:37 PM I see what you mean Rolled a mythic enchant over a rare one on a equipped rune, does not bump my rating in the jungle Removing the rune and re-equipping it helped August 20, 2025 | P90015575 I see what you mean Rolled a mythic enchant over a rare one on a equipped rune, does not bump my rating in the jungle macfable Elite Archer 8/20/25, 9:14 AM i just tried this and now it's trying to quick raid me 10 levels. i exit game and keep upequipping runes hoping it won't quick raid me but it just keeps offering to to quick raid to same level. anyway to avoid this or is it too late? i just tried this and now it's trying to quick raid me 10 levels. i exit game and keep upequipping runes hoping it won't quick raid me but it just keeps offering to to quick raid to same level. anyway to avoid this or is it too late?

Entropy42 Senior Archer 8/21/25, 10:28 PM Once it has calculated your new rating, you're done, there is no way to avoid the skip. In the future, you can unequip or downgrade another rune before equipping your new, higher power rune, then try to slowly increase your rating so you don't skip ahead. It seems like it doesn't recalculate your rating if you upgrade an enchant on an equipped rune until you unequip and re-equip that rune, but I'm not certain. 1 August 22, 2025 Once it has calculated your new rating, you're done, there is no way to avoid the skip.

Peak and guild have no skills so this won't have any effect there Arena you may get some dps boost but I doubt it'll be a game changer Arena you may get some dps boost but I doubt it'll be a game changer murvy Legendary Archer 9/29/25, 10:27 AM What you hit average of 2 skills or so So its 6% dmg boost on second round Maybe 9% on 3rd I can see people getting AoE leg1 for PvE 1 Only rune that makes sense to me So its 6% dmg boost on second round Shadowfax88 Legendary Archer 9/29/25, 10:28 AM And only for the particular dmg source of the etched rune that's at L1 And only for the particular dmg source of the etched rune that's at L1 murvy Legendary Archer 9/29/25, 10:30 AM Yeah Question if its worth getting at all. Like fishing you go for other etched on leg first And GvG you can but with swapping Orbs and Otta. Blessings and enchantium too Not sure if you take AoE L1 after fishing all etched you need on leg. Probably get artifacts first Not sure if you take AoE L1 after fishing all etched you need on leg. Probably get artifacts first Shadowfax88 Legendary Archer 9/29/25, 10:32 AM My initial thought is artifacts first especially if you don't have the set bonus yet. But even then probably better to star up pans flute and tidal conch My initial thought is artifacts first especially if you don't have the set bonus yet. But even then probably better to star up pans flute and tidal conch murvy Legendary Archer 9/29/25, 10:32 AM Yeah I mean it depends on your economy If you need gems for other stuff first but Overall yeah pimpanzee Junior Archer 9/29/25, 3:10 PM Is potion spring any good? I feel like it kinda blows Is potion spring any good? I feel like it kinda blows Exodus the Coach | P90015619 Elite Archer 9/29/25, 3:29 PM Its great when you have nian otta otherwise its mid. Except in pve content the Coach | P90015619 Its great when you have nian otta otherwise its mid. Except in pve content pimpanzee Junior Archer 9/29/25, 3:33 PM Why is it great for nian otta? AFAICT, potions do not trigger anything besides their effects and it seems to not trigger very often I would think I’d be better off long-term with sprites awe vs. 1/4 matches potion spring triggers I would think I’d be better off long-term with sprites awe vs. 1/4 matches potion spring triggers Shadowfax88 Legendary Archer 9/29/25, 3:37 PM Potion spring has the potential to be a game changer in arena. If you have otta's nian skin at 4 or 5 stars and otta at 2 then the potion spring will proc in the majority of battles. If it happens to proc on invincible pot you can beat people with much higher power. Sprites awe is the more consistent option but potion spring has a significantly higher ceiling For full oracle users swords plus potion spring seems to be working better than double sprite etched in arena as far as I can tell. I'm a mixed set user so I haven't tested it personally but that's what it looks like to me from a distance pimpanzee Junior Archer 9/29/25, 3:42 PM Is it 25% chance to spawn every time I grab a pot!? Why is it great for nian otta? AFAICT, potions do not trigger anything besides their effects and it seems to not trigger very often Exodus the Coach | P90015619 Elite Archer 9/29/25, 3:45 PM Even with what shadow inputed if you're running pots springs on oracle for example nian otta pot triggers every 2 sec lvl it up increases the odds to pots every sec and potion magnet mythic increased you're likely hood for pots springs trigger. Its 1/4 but your chances increased with otta and enchant plus the pots skill if you grab it in arena either way you're still having more value even if it doesn't pop (edited) If does pop you're pretty much winning the round For meteor and strikes builds its pretty much standard (edited) Is it 25% chance to spawn every time I grab a pot!? Shadowfax88 Legendary Archer 9/29/25, 4:01 PM Yes, it does. Like exodus said, it shows up in many pvp/gvg builds. Where it doesn't work well is if you use Thor as a resonance because he moves too much and just runs out of the potion spring range too often pimpanzee Junior Archer 9/29/25, 4:08 PM Well that makes much more sense! The description could be clearer. I thought just 25% of matches it would trigger Thanks the Coach | P90015619 October 1, 2025 Fenrirus Novice Explorer 10/1/25, 8:35 AM Oracle user + Thor + otta costume in gvg i should use aoe and which one etched rune(potion, old sword or maybe new sword)? which one push to legendary first. (edited) I think old sword will be the best, but im not sure Oracle user + Thor + otta costume in gvg i should use aoe and which one etched rune(potion, old sword or maybe new sword)? which one push to legendary first. Exodus the Coach | P90015619 Elite Archer 10/1/25, 10:26 AM Running strikes on thor is trash because the strikes won't shoot out unless you're facing them which pretty much thor doesn't do often . If you're going strikes thor is useless Aerie ledgendary then pots spring leg. Pots spring leg just gives more potions when it procs.... but i think Aerie first will net you better results in arena Splits is easier to get ledgendary because you have access to it in guildshop but aerie is still better Guild expo Fenrirus Novice Explorer 10/1/25, 10:54 AM Thanks i have frost shock rune with sword enchant and i saw sword dmg in arena. Never thinked about swords doesnt proc with Thor. I know swords hit only enemy on front of hero Leg aerie better than split ? Split generate 5 swords. I dont know proc chance but its looks better in gvg. On arena i play sumons.

It's +3% dmg of the particular dmg source of the etched rune for each skill of that type taken. Zero benefit in gvg and peak because no skills are available. You'll see some dps increase in arena but it's pretty random in terms of skills. You'll probably only see 2-3 skills of a particular type (if that).

(Same direction as circles) • For now, not sure of a better way to avoid attacks other than hope he spins and lands farther away from you to; first, dodge the charge, then dodge his shots. After shooting, he pretty much preps his charge again. • Think the only solid hope is freezes, shields, and something auto attack like circles since he’s always close range from charging.

September 26, 2025 meteor is also impact by elemental dmg right? as it has different elements too Shadowfax88 Legendary Archer 9/26/25, 10:34 AM Yes, meteors cause supplemental elemental damage. The elemental damage aspect can crit if you have lucky shadow. The explosive meteor damage itself only crits if you have the meteor crit rate enchantment The base 5% crit rate is considered global crit rate. This impacts main weapon, sword strikes and non-explosive meteors. Elemental base crit rate is determined by luck. If you run lucky shadow, I believe the base rate is 10%. This can be increased by elemental crit rate +% enchants on runes and the elemental crit etched. All other (circles, sprites and explosive meteors) have a base crit of 0%. These can only be increased by their specific crit rate +% enchants (except for circles if you have mythic sawblade where circles inherit main weapon crit) Explosions never crit (for example... xbow explosion on hit and other dragoon gear) Awesomethanu Senior Archer 9/26/25, 12:00 PM back to this, it is the same for crit dmg right? if i use xbow with meteor and i have meteor crit rate enchant but dont have meteor crit dmg, does the normal crit dmg applies? or same as crit rate, normal crit dmg works on MW, SWORD STRIKES AND NON EXPLOSIVE METOERS? back to this, it is the same for crit dmg right? if i use xbow with meteor and i have meteor crit rate enchant but dont have meteor crit dmg, does the normal crit dmg applies? Shadowfax88 Legendary Archer 9/26/25, 12:14 PM I'm not positive on this but I'm pretty sure crit damage calculation works like this. All sources of damage that are able to crit have a base crit damage of +50% and additional crit damage is additive to that. Global crit damage works the same way as global crit rate (it only effects main weapon, swords and non explosive meteors). At least this is my understanding but I'm not positive. If you have an enchant for meteor crit damage +30% and that meteor crits it will end up doing 180% damage. I believe the calculation is for explosive meteors is this. Explosive meteor damage (1.25x atk) (explosion multiplier (=3 from xbow) + crit damage multiplier) meteor multiplier (from left side meteor runes) dragoon helm multiplier (=2 if helm is chaotic) (edited) Shadowfax88 Legendary Archer 9/26/25, 12:31 PM I'm pretty sure that formula is accurate. The only thing I'm not certain on is if the global crit damage is also applied to it. I'll see if I can find out (edited) Shadowfax88 Legendary Archer 9/26/25, 12:47 PM I can confirm that elements that crit only use the elemental crit damage multiplier (unless you have the elemental crit etched that allows them to inherit % of character crit). I haven't been able to test meteors because I don't have meteor crit rate enchants Awesomethanu Senior Archer 9/26/25, 12:47 PM how do u do the test i have meteor crit rate but low rate Shadowfax88 Legendary Archer 9/26/25, 12:50 PM By unequiping everything except for runes/gear that have the variables you are testing for and then doing practice runs in seal or invasion. Turn on damage numbers. Meteors are a little harder to test because they also apply elemental damage so the screen gets a little more clogged but is possible Awesomethanu Senior Archer 9/26/25, 1:04 PM It seems like it does. Trying to send you the video Not sure if I done it correctly though File is too big to send Is this crit? Shadowfax88 Legendary Archer 9/26/25, 1:10 PM Yes, that is a crit. But I just got confirmation that explosive meteors that crit just use meteor crit damage multiplier from enchants and not global crit rate Are you sure there were no other variables in your test that may have impacted overall damage numbers? Awesomethanu Senior Archer 9/26/25, 1:17 PM I don’t have any meteor crit dmg enchantments Shadowfax88 Legendary Archer 9/26/25, 1:19 PM That crit damage could be coming from another source then. Such as the xbow attack Plus the base crit damage for explosive meteors is +50% even if you don't have any other ones. The meteor crit damage enchants are additive to that Awesomethanu Senior Archer 9/26/25, 1:21 PM I’m moving towards wall to refrain myself from attacking all the time. Not sure if I slipped my fingers or not but I think most of the time I didn’t. Who are you getting the information from ?

For those with explosion dmg Shadowfax88 Legendary Archer 9/26/25, 1:42 PM You can still use meteor crit rate because of the base crit damage multiplier Yes, that is a crit. But I just got confirmation that explosive meteors that crit just use meteor crit damage multiplier from enchants and not global crit rate TodoNuDeMeias Senior Archer 9/26/25, 2:29 PM So in this case meteors would do 130% if we had a crit enchant of +30%?

I would think no because sprites inherit owner's crit rate I think would refer to global crit rate extremelyaverage Senior Archer 10/3/25, 12:24 PM yeah assist 2.

So global crit would be your base+ artifacts and does not include weapon crit or characters? And I get that we wont know until someone physically tries it Shadowfax88 Legendary Archer 10/3/25, 12:37 PM It's confusing because some things in the game are not worded properly. Anything that says crit +% with no specific damage type modifiers in front of it are typically considered to be global crit and anything that says \"inherit character/owner crit\" would use this number. The exceptions to this are oracle boots, spear, griffin helm and otta 2 which are all worded in a way that would imply global crit but what they really mean are main weapon crit (edited) Rolla's passive, on the other hand, is a global crit multiplier extremelyaverage Senior Archer 10/3/25, 12:38 PM as is otta's passive?

This can be increased by elemental crit rate +% enchants on runes and the elemental crit etched. All other (circles, sprites and explosive meteors) have a base crit of 0%. These can only be increased by their specific crit rate +% enchants (except for circles if you have mythic sawblade where circles inherit main weapon crit) Explosions never crit (for example... xbow explosion on hit and other dragoon gear) Awesomethanu Senior Archer 9/26/25, 12:00 PM back to this, it is the same for crit dmg right? if i use xbow with meteor and i have meteor crit rate enchant but dont have meteor crit dmg, does the normal crit dmg applies?

Shadowfax88 Legendary Archer 9/26/25, 12:14 PM I'm not positive on this but I'm pretty sure crit damage calculation works like this. All sources of damage that are able to crit have a base crit damage of +50% and additional crit damage is additive to that. Global crit damage works the same way as global crit rate (it only effects main weapon, swords and non explosive meteors). At least this is my understanding but I'm not positive. If you have an enchant for meteor crit damage +30% and that meteor crits it will end up doing 180% damage. I believe the calculation is for explosive meteors is this.

I haven't been able to test meteors because I don't have meteor crit rate enchants 4 1 Follow October 1, 2025 ugh so that means regardless, I'll have to go with thor, maybe get rolla to 6 over a very long time, to drop helix. I guess I answered my own question, other than does griffin do more damage at point blank Shadowfax88 Legendary Archer 10/1/25, 10:01 AM Yes, the base dmg of the claw is higher the closer you are to the enemy extremelyaverage Senior Archer 10/1/25, 10:03 AM i was just curious at what distance is the max damage. but so far, no one knows exactly Ok experimenting a little bit. I have thor 0. I doubt I'll get any higher. I was using ice rune on right. at the expense of the right main weapon rune. This resulted in the freeze triggering while not at an ideal distance. By using rolla instead of thor, freeze usually triggers when I'm within melee range assuming I survive the initial freeze. The main difference without thor is that I'm not point blank with the opponent. Does that matter for damage purposes? DELTADavus Senior Archer 10/1/25, 10:11 AM yeah, thats only \"issue\" you either have early freeze and dont get one shotted, or you dont and have the freeze value on close range, thing is, if you get to close range, you win most likely anyway, regardless of that rolla freeze or not Ok experimenting a little bit.

If we are going for damage, lucky shadow gives 10% elemental crit rate, which seems better at expense of 5% defense loss Shadowfax88 Legendary Archer 10/1/25, 11:01 AM I use lucky shadow but I also run a mixed set with the xbow and dragoon helm/boots with griffin amulet and ring. The majority my damage is elemental and explosion damage so lucky shadow feels like a almost must have for me. With a pure griffin set, I'm not so sure. I think it depends on if you survive easily enough to get close to the opponent. Test out both and see which works better (edited) It also depends if you run elemental crit etched or not Without the elemental crit etched I would probably lean towards guardian but I'm not sure RB773 Mythic Archer 10/1/25, 11:13 AM Why not resilience? Why not resilience? Shadowfax88 Legendary Archer 10/1/25, 11:21 AM I was running resilience for minute but it was definitely not as good as lucky shadow in my build even with a close distance preset. I've haven't done much testing with a full griffin pvp build so I can't say for sure resilience vs guardian but my gut feeling would lean towards guardian (don't make any decisions off this, use at your own risk. ) (edited) 1 extremelyaverage Senior Archer 10/1/25, 11:23 AM yeah I'll just test it. I presume once you get your crit damage up lucky shadow will be better long run Shadowfax88 Legendary Archer 10/1/25, 11:23 AM I just checked the top griffin user in my arena cross server and he uses revive and resilience extremelyaverage Senior Archer 10/1/25, 11:24 AM that could just be a super whale do whatever you want thing though Shadowfax88 Legendary Archer 10/1/25, 11:25 AM Could be.

Debating if i should replace the helm too 1 extremelyaverage Senior Archer 10/1/25, 3:50 PM I guess it depends on how often the oracle ability triggers, and then what your crit rate is. If that results in more than double the shots, then oracle helm is better. Math might change if you are using sprite assist but I doubt you are using that. Wait it would have to be more than double because the helmet increases crit damage by 72%. A crit does 150% at baseline, so a 50% increase in damage, so it would have to be 2.5 times more attacks from the helmet using napkin math. I could be wrong tho (edited) @十ͯ Father Steve | 国语ⷡMͤO̾Dͭ ARC2 I’m about to take that step of making chaotic oracle chest to replace my griffin piece.

And 30% main weapon rune is like starting game with the epic attack + 5% more So 40% dracula is like starting the game with Warrior soul? And 30% main weapon rune is like starting game with the epic attack + 5% more renox Legendary Archer 6/29/25, 11:41 PM Warriors souls is 30%, so dracula is even better. Main weapon rune is not an ATK , those 30% will offset the penalty from Front Arrow. So normally if you take Front Arrow it reduces damage of all your arrows by 15%, 2 Front Arrows will reduce it by 30% (so 70% of original arrow damage) With 30% enchant you will start from 130% arrow damage and 2 Front Arrows will bring it down to 100%.

AFAICT, potions do not trigger anything besides their effects and it seems to not trigger very often I would think I’d be better off long-term with sprites awe vs. 1/4 matches potion spring triggers I would think I’d be better off long-term with sprites awe vs. 1/4 matches potion spring triggers Shadowfax88 Legendary Archer 9/29/25, 3:37 PM Potion spring has the potential to be a game changer in arena. If you have otta's nian skin at 4 or 5 stars and otta at 2 then the potion spring will proc in the majority of battles. If it happens to proc on invincible pot you can beat people with much higher power. Sprites awe is the more consistent option but potion spring has a significantly higher ceiling For full oracle users swords plus potion spring seems to be working better than double sprite etched in arena as far as I can tell. I'm a mixed set user so I haven't tested it personally but that's what it looks like to me from a distance pimpanzee Junior Archer 9/29/25, 3:42 PM Is it 25% chance to spawn every time I grab a pot!? Why is it great for nian otta? AFAICT, potions do not trigger anything besides their effects and it seems to not trigger very often Exodus the Coach | P90015619 Elite Archer 9/29/25, 3:45 PM Even with what shadow inputed if you're running pots springs on oracle for example nian otta pot triggers every 2 sec lvl it up increases the odds to pots every sec and potion magnet mythic increased you're likely hood for pots springs trigger. Its 1/4 but your chances increased with otta and enchant plus the pots skill if you grab it in arena either way you're still having more value even if it doesn't pop (edited) If does pop you're pretty much winning the round For meteor and strikes builds its pretty much standard (edited) Is it 25% chance to spawn every time I grab a pot!? Shadowfax88 Legendary Archer 9/29/25, 4:01 PM Yes, it does. Like exodus said, it shows up in many pvp/gvg builds. Where it doesn't work well is if you use Thor as a resonance because he moves too much and just runs out of the potion spring range too often pimpanzee Junior Archer 9/29/25, 4:08 PM Well that makes much more sense! The description could be clearer. I thought just 25% of matches it would trigger Thanks the Coach | P90015619 October 1, 2025 Fenrirus Novice Explorer 10/1/25, 8:35 AM Oracle user + Thor + otta costume in gvg i should use aoe and which one etched rune(potion, old sword or maybe new sword)? which one push to legendary first.

Exodus the Coach | P90015619 Elite Archer 10/1/25, 10:26 AM Running strikes on thor is trash because the strikes won't shoot out unless you're facing them which pretty much thor doesn't do often . If you're going strikes thor is useless Aerie ledgendary then pots spring leg. Pots spring leg just gives more potions when it procs.... but i think Aerie first will net you better results in arena Splits is easier to get ledgendary because you have access to it in guildshop but aerie is still better Guild expo Fenrirus Novice Explorer 10/1/25, 10:54 AM Thanks i have frost shock rune with sword enchant and i saw sword dmg in arena.

(Same direction as circles) • For now, not sure of a better way to avoid attacks other than hope he spins and lands farther away from you to; first, dodge the charge, then dodge his shots. After shooting, he pretty much preps his charge again. • Think the only solid hope is freezes, shields, and something auto attack like circles since he’s always close range from charging.

This will also keep him in close if you are using circle attack/runes. After movement, shoot shoot move. • Second attack is typically jump attack then immediate meteors. If you can get one shot off in between these attacks go for it, but not at the cost of eating a meteor. After the meteors fall, shoot shoot move. • Lastly, you have the flame shot that splits into 6. The triangle method is perfect to avoid this because it may be a charge. Avoid the flame, possibly shoot, move to avoid the flame spread, shoot again.

This is in the hopes when he tosses the boulder, it will cancel. If it’s the triple rock split you’re still good to go. , • The biggest point is to always rotate to dodge in a counterclockwise direction. This is to have to better chance of dodging the tosses.

If that results in more than double the shots, then oracle helm is better. Math might change if you are using sprite assist but I doubt you are using that. Wait it would have to be more than double because the helmet increases crit damage by 72%. A crit does 150% at baseline, so a 50% increase in damage, so it would have to be 2.5 times more attacks from the helmet using napkin math.

Main weapon rune is not an ATK , those 30% will offset the penalty from Front Arrow. So normally if you take Front Arrow it reduces damage of all your arrows by 15%, 2 Front Arrows will reduce it by 30% (so 70% of original arrow damage) With 30% enchant you will start from 130% arrow damage and 2 Front Arrows will bring it down to 100%.

Where it doesn't work well is if you use Thor as a resonance because he moves too much and just runs out of the potion spring range too often pimpanzee Junior Archer 9/29/25, 4:08 PM Monday, September 29, 2025 at 4:08 PM Well that makes much more sense!

(edited) Wednesday, October 1, 2025 at 8:37 AM I think old sword will be the best, but im not sure Oracle user + Thor + otta costume in gvg i should use aoe and which one etched rune(potion, old sword or maybe new sword)? which one push to legendary first. Exodus the Coach | P90015619 Elite Archer 10/1/25, 10:26 AM Wednesday, October 1, 2025 at 10:26 AM Running strikes on thor is trash because the strikes won't shoot out unless you're facing them which pretty much thor doesn't do often . If you're going strikes thor is useless Aerie ledgendary then pots spring leg. Pots spring leg just gives more potions when it procs.... but i think Aerie first will net you better results in arena Splits is easier to get ledgendary because you have access to it in guildshop but aerie is still better Guild expo Fenrirus Novice Explorer 10/1/25, 10:54 AM Wednesday, October 1, 2025 at 10:54 AM Thanks i have frost shock rune with sword enchant and i saw sword dmg in arena. Never thinked about swords doesnt proc with Thor. I know swords hit only enemy on front of hero Leg aerie better than split ? Split generate 5 swords. I dont know proc chance but its looks better in gvg. On arena i play sumons.

A rolling bowling boulder attack that eventually splits into 6. The big boulder will also track/follow. , (If this big boulder hits a wall, it will not split and will disappear) A triple rock split. , (Edit) Lastly, he also shoots 5 fast boulders at that are mostly guaranteed hits if you are close to him. , (If you freeze or paralyze him, he will never throw these) • This boss will always throw with his right arm. • My trick is to stand mostly in between him in the center and the wall. This is in the hopes when he tosses the boulder, it will cancel. If it’s the triple rock split you’re still good to go. , • The biggest point is to always rotate to dodge in a counterclockwise direction. This is to have to better chance of dodging the tosses. If you dodge clockwise, you run a much bigger risk of taking a bolder or rock throw. , (edited) Thursday, May 22, 2025 at 7:37 PM 1 1 October 4, 2025 Fluky Senior Archer 10/4/25, 8:52 AM Saturday, October 4, 2025 at 8:52 AM Do griffin ring and helm have a min distance for bonus to activate?

If that results in more than double the shots, then oracle helm is better. Math might change if you are using sprite assist but I doubt you are using that. Wait it would have to be more than double because the helmet increases crit damage by 72%. A crit does 150% at baseline, so a 50% increase in damage, so it would have to be 2.5 times more attacks from the helmet using napkin math.

And 30% main weapon rune is like starting game with the epic attack + 5% more So 40% dracula is like starting the game with Warrior soul? And 30% main weapon rune is like starting game with the epic attack + 5% more renox Legendary Archer 6/29/25, 11:41 PM Sunday, June 29, 2025 at 11:41 PM Warriors souls is 30%, so dracula is even better. Main weapon rune is not an ATK , those 30% will offset the penalty from Front Arrow. So normally if you take Front Arrow it reduces damage of all your arrows by 15%, 2 Front Arrows will reduce it by 30% (so 70% of original arrow damage) With 30% enchant you will start from 130% arrow damage and 2 Front Arrows will bring it down to 100%.

Except in pve content pimpanzee Junior Archer 9/29/25, 3:33 PM Monday, September 29, 2025 at 3:33 PM Why is it great for nian otta? AFAICT, potions do not trigger anything besides their effects and it seems to not trigger very often I would think I’d be better off long-term with sprites awe vs. 1/4 matches potion spring triggers I would think I’d be better off long-term with sprites awe vs. 1/4 matches potion spring triggers Shadowfax88 Legendary Archer 9/29/25, 3:37 PM Monday, September 29, 2025 at 3:37 PM Potion spring has the potential to be a game changer in arena. If you have otta's nian skin at 4 or 5 stars and otta at 2 then the potion spring will proc in the majority of battles. If it happens to proc on invincible pot you can beat people with much higher power. Sprites awe is the more consistent option but potion spring has a significantly higher ceiling For full oracle users swords plus potion spring seems to be working better than double sprite etched in arena as far as I can tell. I'm a mixed set user so I haven't tested it personally but that's what it looks like to me from a distance pimpanzee Junior Archer 9/29/25, 3:42 PM Monday, September 29, 2025 at 3:42 PM Is it 25% chance to spawn every time I grab a pot!? Why is it great for nian otta?

Its 1/4 but your chances increased with otta and enchant plus the pots skill if you grab it in arena either way you're still having more value even if it doesn't pop (edited) Monday, September 29, 2025 at 3:46 PM If does pop you're pretty much winning the round For meteor and strikes builds its pretty much standard (edited) Monday, September 29, 2025 at 3:48 PM Is it 25% chance to spawn every time I grab a pot!? Shadowfax88 Legendary Archer 9/29/25, 4:01 PM Monday, September 29, 2025 at 4:01 PM Yes, it does. Like exodus said, it shows up in many pvp/gvg builds. Where it doesn't work well is if you use Thor as a resonance because he moves too much and just runs out of the potion spring range too often pimpanzee Junior Archer 9/29/25, 4:08 PM Monday, September 29, 2025 at 4:08 PM Well that makes much more sense! The description could be clearer. I thought just 25% of matches it would trigger Thanks the Coach | P90015619 October 1, 2025 Fenrirus Novice Explorer 10/1/25, 8:35 AM Wednesday, October 1, 2025 at 8:35 AM Oracle user + Thor + otta costume in gvg i should use aoe and which one etched rune(potion, old sword or maybe new sword)? which one push to legendary first. (edited) Wednesday, October 1, 2025 at 8:37 AM I think old sword will be the best, but im not sure Oracle user + Thor + otta costume in gvg i should use aoe and which one etched rune(potion, old sword or maybe new sword)? which one push to legendary first. Exodus the Coach | P90015619 Elite Archer 10/1/25, 10:26 AM Wednesday, October 1, 2025 at 10:26 AM Running strikes on thor is trash because the strikes won't shoot out unless you're facing them which pretty much thor doesn't do often . If you're going strikes thor is useless Aerie ledgendary then pots spring leg. Pots spring leg just gives more potions when it procs.... but i think Aerie first will net you better results in arena Splits is easier to get ledgendary because you have access to it in guildshop but aerie is still better Guild expo Fenrirus Novice Explorer 10/1/25, 10:54 AM Wednesday, October 1, 2025 at 10:54 AM Thanks i have frost shock rune with sword enchant and i saw sword dmg in arena. Never thinked about swords doesnt proc with Thor. I know swords hit only enemy on front of hero Leg aerie better than split ? Split generate 5 swords. I dont know proc chance but its looks better in gvg. On arena i play sumons. October 6, 2025 NEW Rambo Senior Archer Yesterday at 7:23 AM Monday, October 6, 2025 at 7:23 AM Time to update this guide?

I assume Otta should be there but what about the other two? I have ran Thor for the past couple of weeks and it has made a big difference in my results, even though power wise unlocking him was not really a big boost. I assume opponents just miss a lot while I move, but in any case I am a bit hesitant to swap him for DK. Is it even worth spending a bit to unlock DK give I am not going to level any of these two, though hopefully I can get otta 2 someday… So with a 6 Helix, what would the best two pvp resonances be between 0 Otta+skin, 0 Thor and 0 DK?

Debating if i should replace the helm too 1 extremelyaverage Senior Archer 10/1/25, 3:50 PM I guess it depends on how often the oracle ability triggers, and then what your crit rate is. If that results in more than double the shots, then oracle helm is better. Math might change if you are using sprite assist but I doubt you are using that. Wait it would have to be more than double because the helmet increases crit damage by 72%. A crit does 150% at baseline, so a 50% increase in damage, so it would have to be 2.5 times more attacks from the helmet using napkin math. I could be wrong tho (edited) @十ͯ Father Steve | 国语ⷡMͤO̾Dͭ ARC2 I’m about to take that step of making chaotic oracle chest to replace my griffin piece.

Debating if i should replace the helm too 1 extremelyaverage Senior Archer 10/1/25, 3:50 PM Wednesday, October 1, 2025 at 3:50 PM I guess it depends on how often the oracle ability triggers, and then what your crit rate is. If that results in more than double the shots, then oracle helm is better. Math might change if you are using sprite assist but I doubt you are using that. Wait it would have to be more than double because the helmet increases crit damage by 72%. A crit does 150% at baseline, so a 50% increase in damage, so it would have to be 2.5 times more attacks from the helmet using napkin math. I could be wrong tho (edited) Wednesday, October 1, 2025 at 3:54 PM @十ͯ Father Steve | 国语ⷡMͤO̾Dͭ ARC2 I’m about to take that step of making chaotic oracle chest to replace my griffin piece.

And he’s still good for PvP, though not as good as dk nighty Archer Booster 10/4/25, 8:46 AM Saturday, October 4, 2025 at 8:46 AM I don’t really feel dk somehow I think Thor is stronger but that’s jus my feeling tho, What’s about Loki, I’m planning Loki,Thor with otta nian, my Loki is just at 2 star atm the Squirtle Squirt Im running circles in PvP since I’m oracle user Im running circles in PvP since I’m oracle user Shadowfax88 Legendary Archer 10/4/25, 8:56 AM Saturday, October 4, 2025 at 8:56 AM Circles aren't good for full oracle users. Either double sprite etched or if you have otta 2 with her skin at a high enough star than you could go potion spring and swords perhaps I don't use full oracle in pvp but those are two build",

      "content": "arena. If you have otta's nian skin at 4 or 5 stars and otta at 2 then the potion spring will proc in the majority of battles. If it happens to proc on invincible pot you can beat people with much higher power. Sprites awe is the more consistent option but potion spring has a significantly higher ceiling For full oracle users swords plus potion spring seems to be working better than double sprite etched in arena as far as I can tell. I'm a mixed set user so I haven't tested it personally but that's what it looks like to me from a distance pimpanzee Junior Archer 9/29/25, 3:42 PM Monday, September 29, 2025 at 3:42 PM Is it 25% chance to spawn every time I grab a pot!? Why is it great for nian otta? AFAICT, potions do not trigger anything besides their effects and it seems to not trigger very often Exodus the Coach | P90015619 Elite Archer 9/29/25, 3:45 PM Monday, September 29, 2025 at 3:45 PM Even with what shadow inputed if you're running pots springs on oracle for example nian otta pot triggers every 2 sec lvl it up increases the odds to pots every sec and potion magnet mythic increased you're likely hood for pots springs trigger. Its 1/4 but your chances increased with otta and enchant plus the pots skill if you grab it in arena either way you're still having more value even if it doesn't pop (edited) Monday, September 29, 2025 at 3:46 PM If does pop you're pretty much winning the round For meteor and strikes build",
