  "mixed_gear_sets": {
    "how_mixed_gear_works": "Mixed gear sets in Archero 2 allow you to combine different pieces from different sets while still getting some bonuses. Each piece of gear has individual stats, and when you mix sets, you get the individual piece bonuses but not the full set bonuses. This is useful for optimization when you don't have complete sets or when individual pieces have better stats.",
    "mixed_gear_benefits": "Benefits of mixed gear: 1) Better individual stats from high-tier pieces, 2) More flexibility in builds, 3) Can use your best pieces regardless of set, 4) Good for early game when you don't have complete sets, 5) Allows for more customized builds based on your playstyle.",
    "mixed_gear_drawbacks": "Drawbacks of mixed gear: 1) No full set bonuses, 2) Less synergy between pieces, 3) May not be optimal for endgame, 4) Requires more knowledge to optimize properly.",
    "when_to_use_mixed_gear": "Use mixed gear when: 1) You don't have complete sets, 2) Individual pieces have significantly better stats, 3) You're experimenting with builds, 4) You're in early-mid game progression, 5) You want to maximize specific stats over set bonuses."
