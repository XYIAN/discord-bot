This will also keep him in close if you are using circle attack/runes. \nAfter movement, shoot shoot move.\n• Second attack is typically jump attack then immediate meteors. If you can get one shot off in between these attacks go for it, but not at the cost of eating a meteor.\nAfter the meteors fall, shoot shoot move.\n• Lastly, you have the flame shot that splits into 6. The triangle method is perfect to avoid this because it may be a charge.

If that results in more than double the shots, then oracle helm is better. Math might change if you are using sprite assist but I doubt you are using that.\nWait it would have to be more than double because the helmet increases crit damage by 72%. A crit does 150% at baseline, so a 50% increase in damage, so it would have to be 2.5 times more attacks from the helmet using napkin math.

If it happens to proc on invincible pot you can beat people with much higher power.

As shown in the picture above, the top 20% are promoted and the bottom 40% are demoted. Since the bottom 40% are below the top 60%, the number of those promoted (20%) should be multiplied by 3.

Even if lucky shadow does boost DPS, the effect is minimal (like 1/5th or 1/10th of what a luck skill would provide) (edited)\nMonday, July 14, 2025 at 6:31 AM\n2\n2\nrenox\nLegendary Archer\nOP\n7/14/25, 6:49 AM\nMonday, July 14, 2025 at 6:49 AM\nFor reference, epic lucky shadow boosted Lightwing proc chances from 27% to about 28%, so assuming it scales the same way for xbow, you'd get 2-4% Explo boost (depending on rune rarity) below Mythic xbow, and 3-6% boost for Mythic+. As explo dmg is likely to be 30-50% of all your dps, that's not a significant boost\n@renox\nFor reference, epic lucky shadow boosted Lightwing proc chances from 27% to about 28%, so assuming it scales the same way for xbow, you'd get 2-4% Explo boost (depending on rune rarity) below Mythic xbow, and 3-6% boost for Mythic+.

There is a number of scenarios where all your arrows are hitting even without it. Mostly in seal, which I had in mind when doing this (edited)\nMonday, July 14, 2025 at 10:48 AM\nEntropy42\nSenior Archer\n7/14/25, 10:49 AM\nMonday, July 14, 2025 at 10:49 AM\nAh, I understand. The calculator assumes all your extra arrows hit unless that box is checked.\nGiant Arrow, Sticky Bombs, and the one that gives you damage for killing enemies (Killing Wind?) seem to be missing? I'm using it for Shackled Jungle\nrenox\nLegendary Archer\nOP\n7/14/25, 10:52 AM\nMonday, July 14, 2025 at 10:52 AM\nAgain, those are missing from seal, and would be kinda hard too keep at full stack at higher chapters. Just guessing isn't an option, so I just excluded it (edited)\nMonday, July 14, 2025 at 10:58 AM\nFor bombs and Jungle giant arrow we don't have the numbers, and I doubt someone will test it as the mode isn't hard as long as you meet the requirements, which makes it a low priority (edited)\nMonday, July 14, 2025 at 10:55 AM\nEntropy42\nSenior Archer\n7/14/25, 11:01 AM\nMonday, July 14, 2025 at 11:01 AM\nThis is a really cool tool. Great work. Showed me my intuition was off about how good some abilities are.\nAfter using it for a run, the only question I had was why duplicate the check boxes? Couldn't the percentage increases all just be shown on the left side in Column K next to their respective check box? I found myself scrolling back and forth to check the increase and then check the box for whatever I just selected.

In this current state, if I removed right side and added percentages to the table, all dupe skill would have to be unfolded into it's own rows\nEntropy42\nSenior Archer\n7/14/25, 11:12 AM\nMonday, July 14, 2025 at 11:12 AM\nOk, but the left side is separated by rarity too.
