If we are going for damage, lucky shadow gives 10% elemental crit rate, which seems better at expense of 5% defense loss\nShadowfax88\nLegendary Archer\n10/1/25, 11:01 AM\nI use lucky shadow but I also run a mixed set with the xbow and dragoon helm/boots with griffin amulet and ring. The majority my damage is elemental and explosion damage so lucky shadow feels like a almost must have for me. With a pure griffin set, I'm not so sure. I think it depends on if you survive easily enough to get close to the opponent. Test out both and see which works better (edited)\nIt also depends if you run elemental crit etched or not\nWithout the elemental crit etched I would probably lean towards guardian but I'm not sure\nRB_773\nMythic Archer\n10/1/25, 11:13 AM\nWhy not resilience?\n@RB_773\nWhy not resilience?\nShadowfax88\nLegendary Archer\n10/1/25, 11:21 AM\nI was running resilience for minute but it was definitely not as good as lucky shadow in my build even with a close distance preset. I've haven't done much testing with a full griffin pvp build so I can't say for sure resilience vs guardian but my gut feeling would lean towards guardian (don't make any decisions based off this, use at your own risk. Lol) (edited)\n1\nextremelyaverage\nSenior Archer\n10/1/25, 11:23 AM\nyeah I'll just test it.

If that results in more than double the shots, then oracle helm is better. Math might change if you are using sprite assist but I doubt you are using that.\nWait it would have to be more than double because the helmet increases crit damage by 72%. A crit does 150% at baseline, so a 50% increase in damage, so it would have to be 2.5 times more attacks from the helmet using napkin math. I could be wrong tho (edited)\n@十ͯ Father Steve | 国语ⷡMͤO̾Dͭ\nARC2\nI’m about to take that step of making chaotic oracle chest to replace my griffin piece.

Main weapon rune is not an ATK buff, those 30% will offset the penalty from Front Arrow.\nSo normally if you take Front Arrow it reduces damage of all your arrows by 15%, 2 Front Arrows will reduce it by 30% (so 70% of original arrow damage)\nWith 30% enchant you will start from 130% arrow damage and 2 Front Arrows will bring it down to 100%.

And since the arena becomes unplayable 10 minutes before the daily reset, it is recommended to start playing 20-30 minutes before the reset.\nYou could save your tickets and use them all at once on the last day, but I don't know if I would recommend that since you would be wasting 5 tickets each day.\nDoes tickets stack?\n,\n,\nYes.\nIf you have 0-5 tickets when daily reset, it will reset to 5 tickets.\nIf you have 6 or more, the number won't change.\nEvery day, you can gain 3 more by doing daily tasks, 5 more by buying with gems, 50 more by buying with guild coins.\nRegarding other modes, ⁠unknown\nIs there a way to skip the battle?\n,\n,\nThe first option is to buy a monthly card.\n The second option is to press the pause button in the upper left corner right after the battle starts and leave the battle (the result will be reflected).\nWhich build should I use?\n,\n,\nIn arena, Dragoon set is recommended. \nHowever, many people concentrate on Oracle, so I have created a thread to discuss the rune build for Oracle users. ⁠[Check pinned msg] Arena Build… (edited)\n6\nFollow\nEpicJapan | @Me for Help :D\nARC2\nChat Mod\nOP\n4/13/25, 9:30 PM\nWhat is the best strategy when I'm stuck in my current group?\n,\n,\nDeliberately demote one level and achieve a higher ranking in that group. \nSpecifically, check the ranking rewards, see if you would earn more if you dropped one group below you, and decide whether to stay in your current group or be demoted.\nHow exactly do I demote myself?\n,\n,\nKeep your equipment off in preset and lower your power. Then play and lose. \nThe way to check the rank to be demoted depends on the group. \nFor those in the Supreme group, it is easy to see that you will be demoted if your ranking is lower than the displayed ranking. \nFor those in the Diamond Master group, multiply the number of people being promoted by 3 and get below that rank. As shown in the picture above, the top 20% are promoted and the bottom 40% are demoted. Since the bottom 40% are below the top 60%, the number of those promoted (20%) should be multiplied by 3.

Even if lucky shadow does boost DPS, the effect is minimal (like 1/5th or 1/10th of what a luck skill would provide) (edited)\n2\n2\nrenox\nLegendary Archer\nOP\n7/14/25, 6:49 AM\nFor reference, epic lucky shadow boosted Lightwing proc chances from 27% to about 28%, so assuming it scales the same way for xbow, you'd get 2-4% Explo boost (depending on rune rarity) below Mythic xbow, and 3-6% boost for Mythic+. As explo dmg is likely to be 30-50% of all your dps, that's not a significant boost\n@renox\nFor reference, epic lucky shadow boosted Lightwing proc chances from 27% to about 28%, so assuming it scales the same way for xbow, you'd get 2-4% Explo boost (depending on rune rarity) below Mythic xbow, and 3-6% boost for Mythic+.

Doesn't the calculator know whether or not you have tracking?\nrenox\nLegendary Archer\nOP\n7/14/25, 10:48 AM\nNot having tracking doesn't equal \"other arrows don't hit\". There is a number of scenarios where all your arrows are hitting even without it. Mostly in seal, which I had in mind when doing this (edited)\nEntropy42\nSenior Archer\n7/14/25, 10:49 AM\nAh, I understand. The calculator assumes all your extra arrows hit unless that box is checked.\nGiant Arrow, Sticky Bombs, and the one that gives you damage for killing enemies (Killing Wind?) seem to be missing? I'm using it for Shackled Jungle\nrenox\nLegendary Archer\nOP\n7/14/25, 10:52 AM\nAgain, those are missing from seal, and would be kinda hard too keep at full stack at higher chapters. Just guessing isn't an option, so I just excluded it (edited)\nFor bombs and Jungle giant arrow we don't have the numbers, and I doubt someone will test it as the mode isn't hard as long as you meet the requirements, which makes it a low priority (edited)\nEntropy42\nSenior Archer\n7/14/25, 11:01 AM\nThis is a really cool tool. Great work. Showed me my intuition was off about how good some abilities are.\nAfter using it for a run, the only question I had was why duplicate the check boxes? Couldn't the percentage increases all just be shown on the left side in Column K next to their respective check box? I found myself scrolling back and forth to check the increase and then check the box for whatever I just selected. (edited)\nrenox\nLegendary Archer\nOP\n7/14/25, 11:04 AM\nThe idea was to separate skills by rarities as this is how they are offered to you. In this current state, if I removed right side and added percentages to the table, all dupe skill would have to be unfolded into it's own rows\nEntropy42\nSenior Archer\n7/14/25, 11:12 AM\nOk, but the left side is separated by rarity too. And don't all the dupe skills have the same dps increase (at least for the next one). Your work, your design, just offering some feedback.\nrenox\nLegendary Archer\nOP\n7/14/25, 11:12 AM\nIt probably wouldn't be to hard to implement, but tbh I exhausted all my desire for tinkering further while implementing calculations for fire DoT between attacks\nEntropy42\nSenior Archer\n7/14/25, 11:12 AM\nHah\nI think I could implement it in my copy by just dragging those fields over, we'll see (edited)\nYou'Re Viewing Older Messages\nJump To Present\n\nrenox\nLegendary Archer\nOP\n7/13/25, 7:31 AM\nThis is my last project for Archero 2, a result of work of about a dozen people over the last 4-6 months.
