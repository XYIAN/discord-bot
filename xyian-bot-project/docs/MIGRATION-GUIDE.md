# Migration Guide - Project Structure Cleanup

## Overview

This guide explains the changes made during the project structure cleanup and how to adapt your development workflow.

## What Changed

### Project Structure
- **Before**: Mixed files in root and `xyian-bot-project/` directories
- **After**: Clean monorepo with `xyian-bot-project/` as single source of truth

### File Locations
- **Main Bot Files**: Now only in `xyian-bot-project/`
  - `ultimate-xyian-bot.js`
  - `working-rag-system.js`
  - `training-system.js`
- **Configuration**: Root contains only deployment configs
- **Documentation**: Moved to `xyian-bot-project/docs/`
- **Scripts**: Consolidated in `xyian-bot-project/scripts/`

### Archived Directories
The following directories were moved to `archive/old-project-structures/`:
- `xyian-bot/` - Old bot implementation
- `src/` - TypeScript source code
- `discord-bot/` - Debug utilities
- `services/` - API server code

## Development Workflow Changes

### Starting the Bot
```bash
# Old way (from root)
node ultimate-xyian-bot.js

# New way (from root)
npm start

# Or directly from xyian-bot-project/
cd xyian-bot-project
npm start
```

### Working with Code
- **All bot development** now happens in `xyian-bot-project/`
- **Root directory** is only for deployment configuration
- **Import paths** are relative to `xyian-bot-project/`

### Railway Deployment
- **Configuration**: Root `railway.json` points to `xyian-bot-project/`
- **Build Process**: Automatically installs dependencies in subdirectory
- **Start Command**: Runs from `xyian-bot-project/`

## File Path Updates

### Data Paths
- **Before**: `path.join(__dirname, 'xyian-bot-project', 'data', ...)`
- **After**: `path.join(__dirname, 'data', ...)`

### Import Paths
- **Before**: Mixed relative and absolute paths
- **After**: All relative paths from `xyian-bot-project/`

## Troubleshooting

### Bot Won't Start
1. Check you're running from correct directory
2. Verify `xyian-bot-project/` contains all files
3. Check import paths in error messages

### Missing Files
1. Check `archive/old-project-structures/` for moved files
2. Verify files are in `xyian-bot-project/` directory
3. Check git status for uncommitted changes

### Railway Deployment Issues
1. Verify root `railway.json` points to `xyian-bot-project/`
2. Check `xyian-bot-project/railway.json` configuration
3. Ensure all dependencies are in `xyian-bot-project/package.json`

### Import Errors
1. Check all `require()` statements use relative paths
2. Verify file locations in `xyian-bot-project/`
3. Run `node validate-data-quality.js` to check data paths

## Benefits of New Structure

### Cleaner Organization
- Clear separation between deployment config and bot code
- Single source of truth for all bot files
- Easier to maintain and understand

### Railway Best Practices
- Root directory contains only deployment configuration
- Subdirectory contains actual application code
- Proper monorepo structure

### Better Development Experience
- Clear file locations
- Consistent import paths
- Easier to find and modify code

## Rollback Instructions

If you need to rollback to the old structure:

1. **Restore from backup branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout backup-before-cleanup
   ```

2. **Or manually restore**:
   - Copy files from `archive/old-project-structures/` back to root
   - Restore original `package.json` and `railway.json` files
   - Update import paths back to original structure

## Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check this migration guide
2. Review the CHANGELOG for detailed changes
3. Check `xyian-bot-project/DATA-STRUCTURE.md` for data organization
4. Run validation scripts to verify setup
