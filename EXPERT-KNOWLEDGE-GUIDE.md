## ðŸ§  **Knowledge Enhancement Methods**

### **Method 1: Interactive Knowledge Injection**

**Step 1: Start the injector**
```bash
node expert-knowledge-injector.js
```

**Step 2: Choose your enhancement type**
- **Add Expert Knowledge Entry** - Your specific game knowledge
- **Add Advanced Strategy** - Complex strategies and tactics
- **Add Meta Analysis** - Current meta trends and insights
- **Add Resource Link** - Trusted sources for validation

**Step 3: Follow the prompts**
The tool will ask you for:
- Topic/Question
- Your expert knowledge/answer
- Category (characters/weapons/pvp/f2p/events/progression)
- Confidence level (0.1-1.0)
- Sources (optional)

### **Method 2: Programmatic Knowledge Addition**

```javascript
const KnowledgeEnhancementSystem = require('./knowledge-enhancement-system');
const knowledgeSystem = new KnowledgeEnhancementSystem();

// Add your expert knowledge
knowledgeSystem.addExpertKnowledge(
    "supreme arena meta",
    "**SUPREME ARENA META**: Current meta requires 3 different characters with 3 different builds. Dragoon is #1 choice for mobility, Griffin dominates with full build, third slot flexible. Each unique item provides bonus health and damage.",
    "pvp",
    0.95,
    ["your_expertise", "competitive_analysis"]
);

// Add advanced strategy
knowledgeSystem.addAdvancedStrategy(
    "Dragoon Mobility Build",
    "Focus on movement speed, attack speed, and positioning. Use Multi-shot, Ricochet, Piercing skills. Revive Rune is essential.",
    "pvp",
    ["Dragoon character", "S-tier weapons", "Revive Rune"],
    ["Practice positioning", "Save ultimate for key moments", "Learn enemy patterns"]
);
```

### **Method 3: Direct Database Enhancement**

**Edit the main Q&A database directly:**
```javascript
// In ultimate-xyian-bot.js, add to archeroQA object:
const archeroQA = {
    // ... existing entries ...
    
    // Your expert knowledge
    "your_topic": "**YOUR EXPERT KNOWLEDGE**: Your detailed explanation with specific strategies, numbers, and insights.",
    "advanced_mechanics": "**ADVANCED MECHANICS**: Your deep understanding of complex game systems.",
    "meta_analysis": "**META ANALYSIS**: Your insights into current competitive trends and strategies."

## ðŸ”§ **Advanced Knowledge Enhancement**

### **1. Validation Rules**
Add rules to catch incorrect information:
```javascript
const validationRules = [
    {
        pattern: "weapon.*scythe|sword|windforce",
        action: "flag_incorrect",
        message: "These weapons don't exist in Archero 2. Only 3 S-tier weapons: Oracle Staff, Griffin Claws, Dragoon Crossbow."
    },
    {
        pattern: "thor.*weapon|mjolnir.*weapon",
        action: "flag_incorrect",
        message: "Thor's Mjolnir is an ability, NOT a weapon. Thor is a character, not a weapon."
    }
];
```

### **2. Resource Links**
Add trusted sources for validation:
```javascript
knowledgeSystem.addResourceLink(
    "Archero 2 Official Discord",
    "https://discord.gg/archero2",
    "community",
    "Official community for updates and strategies"
);
```

### **3. Training Data Creation**
Create comprehensive training data:
```javascript
const trainingData = {
    expertQAPairs: [
        {
            question: "What's the best character for Supreme Arena?",
            answer: "For Supreme Arena, you need 3 different characters with 3 different builds. Dragoon is the #1 choice for mobility builds, Griffin dominates with full build optimization, and the third slot is flexible.",
            confidence: 0.95,
            category: "pvp"
        }
    ],
    advancedStrategies: [
        {
            name: "Supreme Arena Team Building",
